I buy the books for my wife and she is enjoying them in her retirement along with all the other products we purchased from Amazon	2
Since it was free, I decided to read "Pride and Prejudice" again. I was hoping I would like it more than I did when I was in college. I know you are all going to hate me, and never look at another one of my reviews, but honestly it is one of the few titles that I actually believe I liked the movie better. There, I said it. Maybe it is because modern screenwriters are able to present their attraction to each other better than Jane Austen could in 1800's. The movie is one of my favorites. I still get chills when Mr. Darcy tells Elizabeth she has bewitched him. If you haven't read it, you simply must, just so you can always say you read the book that started it all--romance novels that is. Anyway, there you are. That's my review, and I'm sticking to it.	3
Sorry, I don't want to step on any toes, but I found Pride & Prejudice to be slow and plodding. In fact, I finished it only for the sake of doing so. Since it was written by a woman and is told primarily from a woman's perspective, given its considerable popularity I can only assume that it is enjoyed more by women than by men. If it wasn't a classic I might even have given it two stars (and I enjoy many of the classics very much).	3
Why is this still being published? How does anyone finish this stuff? The women are pathetic, their lives meaningless; the men are shallow; thank goodness I don't have to live in such a self centred universe. I'd rather shoot them all in the first five pages, and let characters who are trying to contribute to others' lives get more oxygen. Talk about suffering for Austen's art - she did, so we have to too? Give me strength!!	1
i have not yet read the book(too buzy rereading harry potter fo the third time) but i might eventually(5 starz rating just becuz)my questin is why buy it when the book it for free right above this title???(on the kidle touch sstre anyways; its the project gutenberg version	5
This book was in amazing condition. I bought it Like New and it looked like it hadn't been handled at all, something I could have purchased at the store. The package was delivered way before expectancy, as well.	5
Was writing a review of Austen's novel Emma on Amazon. Got through seven or eight substantial paragraphs, and a fully committed point of view. After everything I wrote, Amazon told me ( only after I wrote the review) that, for technical reasons, they wouldn't be publishing my comment. I wasn't even able to save it since, but it was a good review. Hope they'll be publishing this one after this item, submitting my complaint...	4
Pride and Prejudice deserves a 5 star rating, but this Kindle edition is sloppy, and "free" is not an excuse. Those familiar with Jane Austen, and P&P in particular, need only search for "call her mother a wit" to see what I mean.	2
This novel is about the story of five daughters with an elderly father and an opportunistic Mrs. Bennet, their daughters will never pronounce the word mother.Mr. Bennet having five unmarried daughters is preoccupied because, according to the law a daughter (if not married) cannot inherit the estate where they actually lives.Another aspects of this novel is the centrality of the letters and their messages fundamentals for the develop of the story.The most important letter is those written by Mr. Darcy to Elizabeth nor for his amorous declaration but for explain to Elizabeth why he has refused Jane and the Mr. Wickham's heredity.In my opinion the pride and prejudice of this novel revolves around the main characters, in particular when Elizabeth is conscious and recognise her prejudice in the confront of Mr. Darcy, the pride is to have discovered a true and unconditional love.The main characters are Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, the most hated is Mr.Collins.Elizabeth is intelligent romantic generous determined sensible and rude girl, in brief she is the antithesis of a homophobic world.In my opinion Mr. Collins an handsome guy but he is a person full of hate and his aim is engage on his suffering the people around him.The opposite is Mr. Darcy, his external appearance is rude and provocative, but his soul is noble romantic and altruistic and surprisingly he is against the classism of the British society, the souls of Mr.Darcy and Mr. Darcy are very similar.CheersItalo	5
I picked this book up from my daughter's bookshelf and thought it might be fun to read such a classic. I have to say I am disappointed. About halfway through, I grew so thoroughly bored, I had to put the book down for a few days. It is just a predictable romance novel, nothing especially wonderful or exciting. There is so much conversations and it can get really confusing sometimes.	2
I think I got about a quarter of the way through it and hoped it would get better. The story is hard to follow, too detailed about mundane things. The story line is so slow I just gave up. I enjoy historical romances and I figured a classic, right? Should be good. Nope, it was a waste of my time.	1
What more can be said about one of the greatest works in the English language? A life lived without reading this book must be deemed a complete failure on all counts.	5
This is the first classic that I have ever read! I think that it was a great first choice to start reading these sort of novels.Recommended! :)	4
Good story but quite difficult to read. The dialect seems archaic and hard to follow many times. If one can interpret the dialect, the story is charming.	4
Excellent 100% fulfilled in time, form and quality. Congratulations, and hopefully always remain so and so retain the confidence that you deposited your customers	4
I own both Insight Editions of "Pride & Prejudice" and "Sense & Sensibility" and I only wish they had continued this series to include all of Jane Austen's major novels - Northanger Abbey, Mansfield Park, and Persuasion. The notes in the margins provide historical context, insights into Jane Austen's own life, and chatty asides from the editor that make you feel like you're reading the book along with an intelligent friend or book club. It is a fun introduction to Jane Austen's books for those new to Austen, and it's just another way to enjoy this classic book and really feel a connection to and a part of the kinds of conversations of "Janeites" JASNA meetings and book groups. It is an accessible edition of the book - less academic than the Norton Critical Edition, without compromising the experience of just reading Austen's books for fun.	5
I have always been a romantic. I`m that sucker who is always looking for a great romance novel or movie to captivate me and make me fall into the wonders of love overcoming all obstacles. So, yes, you could say I have seen and read my fair share of love stories, but this is the best.I first read this book when I was 12 after hearing incessesantly about how it was such a classic and a must-read (and of course I heard it was a romance, so that little fact right there solidified any scruples that I may have had at the time). I was mesmerized.Yes, of course it was rather difficult to understand the language at first and I did expect that. Instantly, though, I read it a second time and I locked in with Austen`s flow of words and the sensations that I went through while reading her novel were incredible.Elizebeth Bennet is such a fantastic and relatable character and I believe any woman can relate to her. She`s dignified and witty, but at the same time she`s shy and believable. She`s never ridiculous or over the top. Mr. Darcy....where do I begin? The changes in him and Elizabeth are just incredible and no matter how many times I read this book I can`t help but fall in love with them all over again. Mrs. Bennet is truly ridiculous, but she means well. Mr. Bennet is a man who always settles and never really has determination to go ahead. He keeps to himself, sometimes it seems like he even avoids the truth of things unless it becomes dreadfully grave. Nonetheless, a great character. Mr. Collins; What a man! He will keep you laughing at how absolutely ridiculous he is. And Elizabeth`s younger sisters are truly precious. Jane and Bingley are sweet and endearing. Miss Bingley is the perfect &#34;mean girl&#34;. Mr. Wickham is delightfully decieving and really supports the phrase, &#34;Looks are decieving.&#34; And lastly, the Gardiners are easily my favorite characters after Elizabeth and Darcy.The whole plot is wonderfully paced, and I will confess that first time reading it that it may seem slow and boring. But, when you really take the time to delve into Jane Austen`s world and understand the truths that she expresses with such precision that still resonate in todays society, you really become intranced. You really feel like you know the characters and maybe even recognize the truth in them and recognize people you know. Austen was insightful and really understood people and characters and the morals of her time. She was brillant and I really wonder what it would be like to have met her if she was alive today. Pride ad Prejudice is my favorite novel and I really hope this review has done is justice. This is the best of the best and it will forever remain my favorite novel.Thank you Jane Austen for sharing with the world your characters and your truths.	5
love this classic!!! only, what's with the incomplete names/titles? eg: ----shire ? I've read my grans' copy of this and it did not have those....	4
I am not sure why everyone is so negative about this timeless classic. Yes there are no big car chase scenes, no unusually attractive female that makes everyone go "gaga", or large scale destruction. If you can get away from this and look at the story with a open mind and conscience, you will get a story that is moving and just right for just about anyone. I loved it and I think that it never gets old. Slow is the way and steady is the hand that created this masterpiece.	5
a true classic. i have always wanted to read this book, and i was not disappointed.Although set in the 1800s it continues to teach life lessons and I highly recommend it.	5
I adore Elizabeth and the fact that she is headstrong and opinionated in this time when that was beyond frowned upon. I like Jane and her shyness. I LOVED Bingley and his charismatic charm. I also really love Mr Bennet and his sense of humor. Mrs Bennet & Lydia Bennet on the other hand were those characters you alway wanted to smack in the face for being so stupid...like so:And then there is Darcy.... At first, like everyone else, I wasn't very into him. He was standoffish and he insulted Elizabeth behind her back mere moments after meeting her! Seriously, what is wrong with you dude? I was fuming as much as Elizabeth...but then you realize that he is shy and awkward when conversing with people he doesn't know and he does all this amazing stuff just to help Elizabeth. I followed Elizabeth right down the rabbit whole when she started to fall for Darcy.My only real complaint, oddly enough, was the prose. I truly did not expect the way it was written to bug me. I am an historical romance novel fanatic so you would assume that this would be right up my alley, no?But it really wasn't. Apparently I only like to listen to them speak this way, not read it. When I hear them speak, it's like aw! He is paying her an extreme compliment and using all these pretty words. When I read it, the dialogue I can handle, but the entire page of description that basically amounts to "they lived in a large house called Longbourne that had many rooms and a lot of land with woods"....well I wasn't so into that. And when Mr Collins spoke, I had the biggest urge to just yell at him to spit it out already! Seriously dude, pull your head out of Lady Catherine's ass and speak for yourself! Stop paying Lady Catherine compliments every other word! Trust me, we understand that you think she is the awesome.Wow...this is probably the crappiest review I have ever written, but seriously there are tons of reviews out there that really explain what this book is about as well as several films, so if my review has left you confused, please go consult one of them (or just google it) and they will answers your numerous questions.	4
Pride... and prejudice... just like it says... Allows us to spy on a world and in a time we'll never know, where pride rules at the expense of others, and prejudice is at its best... If you see yourself in the pages, it's a good thing to step back and think about how to change... or read just for the enjoyment.	5
This is my favorite Jane Austin novel. The characters are so well developed and the descriptions so perfect I felt I was there with them. I loved getting lost in the story and couldn't wait to read what happened next. I would recommend this book to anyone!	5
Jane Austen had great sociological, cultural and anthropological insights at her time. However, most of her works sound quite applicable and reasonable today as well, so many years onwards, i.e. after her. Nonetheless, her literary talent and skill are still unsurpassed. This story in particular is told in a very intuitive and psychological way, being very personal and touching, at the same time. The author is constantly flowing in the realms of human mentality, feelings and emotions; whereas keeping very sound and practical judgments on the wide social world surrounding the protagonist. Overall, it is a lovely story involving a whole spectrum of human moods, feelings and conditions, such as: love, romance, grief, happiness, longing, desire, rivalry, remorse, achievement etc.	5
Admittedly a challenge in verse from today's language... once beyond that, one is easily transported back in time and entranced by Austen's story-telling!	5
Of course you know why this rating is a five. Pride and Prejudice is one of the most amazing love stories I've EVER read. Honestly the writing style is not something I could read often, but this is a beautiful-reach in and touch your soul kind of read...Of course the movie is amazing as well, but I stand by what I always say-The book is ALWAYS better.	5
I know most teens whine & complain when assigned classics to read for school, but this book is so much more than required reading. I first read it in 5th grade (my reading level was advanced for my age #humblebrag lol) and I read it over and over, never tiring of the crisp, Victorian language or heart-rending love story. Read with an open mind!	5
Product was received a promised. I find ordering from Amazon to be very convenient and all products are usually price competitive.	5
Hadn't read this book in years and couldn't put it down just like last time. Very happy to have found it for free and didn't find any errors or differences that would make me believe it was different.	5
You know how you decide to read a classic becuase you assume that any book that has survived for this long to be great? Then the entire time you read the book you hate it, but you are sure there is some reason it's a classic. Finally, at the end of the book, you realize that you just wasted your time reading an awful book. Well, this book isn't like that. It's actually really great. There are twists in the plot, a surprising end, good characters, and a loveable heroine. If you like romance, then this is the book for you.	5
The description was exactly as written. Fast shipping and great costumer service. I would recommend the product and the seller.	5
I read the first 100 pages of Pride and Prejudice and then I bailed.I was taking some very heavy damage from several hardened missile silos down below me. I had lost all aileron control and the self-sealing fuel tanks, well, were no longer self-sealing. I had to eject fast or I would auger in from 10,000 feet. I fought my way out of the pilot seat against the compiling G-forces and scrambled with a sob in my throat through the open hatchway.Tumbling in free fall. Feeling of helplessness. Cold air rushing past my ears. I pulled the rip cord and felt the hard snap as my parachute opened and the last I ever saw of Pride and Prejudice was the book dwindling against the bright stars overhead, lost to me forever.I'm telling you I barely made it out of that book alive.	2
I purchased this book before Thanksgiving which was supposed to arrive between the 12th and the 21st. I still have not received it. Meanwhile I purchased two other books from other suppliers which arrived within 2 weeks. I will never purchase from this supplier again.Extremely dissatisfied!	1
When I got this book for a Christmas I was not sure if I got the right one for my girlfriend. After she recieved it as a gift she did let me know it was the wrong one :( We contacted the lady who sold it to us and she said no return !! She was rude and I will not buy a thing from Amazon again . If you let losers like this sell things and not back it up why should I ever take the chance again ? I thought there would be a return policy. Guess there is not :( I hope no one buys from this lady again !!!	1
why does amazon sell books which classic are and are available everybody in usual libraries or via internet?does amazon have not enough money to sell what is free?	1
This is just very boring. Amazon should put more exciting book on the free list, such as, The CHERUB series by Robert Muchamore, Cris Ryan books, and espionge.	1
I recently had a chance to see the full Masterpiece Theater production of Pride and Prejudice (if you have never seen Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, you haven't lived) and loved it as much as ever. Now that I have a Kindle and many of the classics are free I couldn't resist. I recalled that the dialogue in the series was almost verbatim from the book but I hadn't read the book in so many years that I couldn't recall how well the rest matched up. They are different because the book does a lot of narration that in the film had to be shown by activity, so it gives a different insight into your favorite characters. I was delighted to find so much in the book not in the series.The book is a perfect delight and it obvious why this treasure by Jane Austin ranks so high in the lists of English literature. Austin's skill at dialogue, character and plot development are unmatched. I had intended to just skim the book to pick up the pieces I wanted but I read every word and was delighted with the extra sections in the book not in the series. I highly recommend it.	5
I just finished reading the book about half an hour ago. I read it in almost two weeks, since the complexity of my life's schedule did not let me finish it in less time. Let me assure you that it is a good title, and I look forward to reading more on Jane Austen. I enjoyed the reading so much in my Kindle that one day was reading at the University, waiting for some Registration assistance, and I began laughing on the occurrences of Lady de Bourgh at Longbourn.I gave this title a 4 star review since some formatting problems on the Kindle edition; including capital letters where there was no need, word and line spacing, and not coming with a list of the Chapters to be read.Although I found these errors sometimes annoying, I enjoyed quite much the experience of reading this ebook, since I never thought I would enjoy an 1800's title.Enjoy your reading!	4
I read this book because I have been trying to catch up on some classics of literature that I haven't read. I expected to find it to be boring and stuffy, but I vowed that I would read it. To my great fortune, my prejudice against the book turned out to be completely wrong. It is wonderful book and a great read. It is witty, funny, and perceptive, with great insights into human relationships and the structure of society during its era (late eighteenth century England).	5
I've read this book so often, I can actually quote word for word. Within the first few pages you forget which century you're in, and really feel for Elizabeth and Jane as their sisters and mother embarrass them in society. You feel poor Darcy's bemusement at falling in love with someone from a (perceived) lower class, and you ache for Lizzie to unbend a little and cut the guy some slack. When they finally get it on, I breathe a huge sigh of relief that everything's turned out so wonderfully. Yes, even though I must have read it over a hundred times. And that's timeless fiction.	5
Please note that this review is on the hard cover edition offered here via Barns and Noble. Amazon, for reasons known only to themselves, have chosen to lump every review of the classic piece of literature together no matter the format. As I go through these reviews I find that hard cover editions, e-books, books on tape, unknown bindings, paperbacks and I don't know what all have all been thrown into the same bag.Let me be perfectly honest and tell you that as far as Austen's work itself, I would give it ten stars if that were possible. This is NOT a review of her work though, rather a review of this particular edition...as stated above. I recently went of a book buying spree for my wife to replace worn out, lost (she is a great loaner of books and many of those loaned books never find there way home), and simply misplaced books. She, like me, is a big Austen fan.Anyway, the Barns and Noble edition book described on this product page is a very fine book when you consider the cost. It is difficult to find a decent paperback book these days, much less a hardback version of anything that does not cost an arm and a leg if bought new.Now so with this printed hard back version. The book is well made. The paper, while not of fine are quality, is certainly nice enough. The binding appears quite good...I know about such things and for a mass produced books this is about as good as you are going to find anywhere. The cost is more than reasonable . (Hey...a supersized extra value meal will cost you more), and font used is extremely readable and easy on the eyes.If you order this book you must pay shipping charges; something to consider. I personally bought mine, along with a number of the `classics' in this series directly at a B&N; store, (We drive to the big city at least every other month), thus saving the cost of S&H.;For a big bang for your buck, I can hardly see how you can go wrong with this one.As to the work itself; if you have not read this one, do so. You are in for a true reading treat. If you have read it before, then read it again! If you are one of those that simply do no like Austen's work...well, don't read it at all!Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks	5
I consider myself a moderately well read person, as I have read a few of the must read classics, yet I had not embarked on one of literature's most celebrated journey, the journey into the land of Longbourn and Pemberly as seen in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. A few years ago I selected the book to attempt to read it, but I became immediately bored with the literature and tossed it aside, deciding against finishing it.I came across a book claiming to be a sequel of Pride and Prejudice (and a bad sequel I must say) and I decided to give the classic another try.I cannot ascertain why, but this time, something was changed. Before I finished the first chapter, I was completely entranced in the story of the Bennet's and later, Darcy and the Bingelys.At first, I was completely ignorant of the time period's lingo and I was flailing, reading slowly to completely understand the richness of the grand words. But by the middle of the book, I was fluent in the old English tongue and my native tongue, American English, was past.The plot and dialogue was like no other book I have had the pleasure of reading. The sheer brilliance of Austen's artfully crafted words and wonderful plot left me wishing the book would never reach its finish.But it did.I nearly cried when I bid farewell to my newly acquainted friends, Fitzwilliam Darcy, Elizabeth Bennet, Jane Bennet, Georgiana Darcy, Mr. Bingely, Charlotte Lucas, and the laughable Mr. Collins. An emptiness accompanied me, as I put the book the down, the aching, despairing emptiness that makes you wish that you were in the book, and lucky enough to know the characters.And this is why I encourage you to pick up Pride and Prejudice. You may be like me and either be intimidated by the vast use of vocabulary or have sampled the book before and found it not to your taste.I urge you to try again. All it took was another try and just like that, I was in love with the book forever.Look past the hard words or the moderate length and look directly into a charming book that is sure to captivateyou and draw you in as it did me.Pride and Prejudice is a timeless classic, full of eloquent words, beautiful romance, and a few twist and turns. Pride and Prejudice will always be my favorite book and will always have a hallowed spot on my bookshelf.Is anyone else in love with Mr. Darcy?	5
I can't even begin to tell you all how much I loved this book (I loved it most ardently!). It was sweet, heartfelt and real! I felt connected to the characters in a way that I have never been connected with a character before, and that's saying a lot because I'm a very intense reader. I ususally grieve when I finish a book I love, and this was no exception. I think I'm still grieving a little, and It's been almost a week since I've read it!Jane Austen is one of the most if not THE most admirable writers of all time. You can't stay out of her stories. SHe grabs you and pulls you right in there with Elizabeth and Darcy and everyone else, making you fall in love with each and every character deeply.	5
If I were reviewing Pride and Prejudice alone, I would give this novel six stars. It is rightfully listed on every top 100 literature list. I am currently reading it for the sixth time and still finding wonderful new things in the story. For those who have only seen the movie versions, you are in for a treat... no movie can do this story justice.My complaint is that the Kindle version I purchased was advertised as illustrated, but there are very few illustrations and the quality is poor, and there is no way to zoom in to see the illustrations better (as you can do with text on the Kindle). This is a past-copyright book and it is available free from the Gutenberg Project, and used to be free on Kindle. I paid 99 cents to get the illustrated version, and it really wasn't worth it. Seriously.	4
I still think Jane Austin should be required reading for every junior high school girl. It is romantic history at its best.	5
A great book that should be read every year by everyone. I bought the Kindle edition and was very happy with it. I keep it on my reader so I can go back and read different sections once in awhile. A great introduction to Austin...	5
Sweetest love story. I love the back and forth between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth, they were absolutely meant for each other!	5
This is a must read for all Who enjoy romance. On of the best love stories with none of the sex that defines a romance novel in the present.	5
Delivered instantly to my kindle. It is an absolute classic that I highly enjoyed. I would recommend my friends to get this too.	5
Classic stories are not my type, i find it boring and tiring to read. But this one is different, it is a fun read! Great story addition to my collection!	5
a wonderful book recommend for all to read. Old book and still a good one to read. Wonderful read for all	5
My wife and daughters LOVE the characters MS Austen created. They are oft-quoted in my house, and usually to a laugh or two (&#34;Oh, sister......!&#34;)A little late, but thanks, Ms Austen, for creating such timeless characters!	5
I can't imagine ever reading another novel with as much dept .Miss Jane, I tip my hat to you!!! The ultimate book	5
The book is a classic and my all time favorite. I read it every year, so I bought it for my Kindle. The Illustrated edition is not worth an extra cost, as they are light and you can't read the type below them on the Kindle.	4
This classic became available for free on my Kindle. I had read the book twice years ago and was excited to be able to add it to my Kindle library. There's something amazing about this love story between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth that I could read again and again.	5
In the Pride and prejudice era, a woman's means of survival and finances was determined by the men in her life-first her father and then Her husband. This is the story of the five Bennett sisters and their quest for suitable husbands. Their felicity in life depends on overcoming pride and prejudice to follow their heart in matters of matrimony. This was a fun story that left me longing for social norms of yesteryear.	5
I read it in high school but really didn't appreciate it then. Upon re-reading it I loved it even more. The story line is relevant, and the story is a classic. Enjoyed very much and definitely think it was better the second time around!	5
Love the times this was written in, romance, etiquette, loyalty, less stress with slower pace of life, and family commitment.	5
Classic! What can I say, but a good classic story! If you haven't read it you should, it's a good read and a FREE download to your kindle!	5
Great quality, love the penguins hardback classics. You won't regret buying these, worth every penny.A great gift as well for any reader, especially a Jane Austen fan.	5
Realmente un cl&aacute;sico, que he le&iacute;do varias veces y puedo seguir leyendo. Digno representante del romanticismo, describe las costumbres de la &eacute;poca en la campi&ntilde;a inglesa	4
Very very well written. I want a man like Darcy even if he was arrogant oh and amazing book indeed !	5
It's a classic, no two words about it. But most of all, it brings to mind the author (Jane Austen) who managed to intertwine her own experiences into this book (the movie 'Becoming Jane' is worth seeing on the occasion).Brilliant language, captivating dialogs and complexity of feelings.	5
I first fell in love with the story after watching the movie. The book is so much better, it was all I hoped for and more.	5
I had never read the book, though I had seen the movie many times. I really enjoyed it and would read it again.	5
I have watched the movie many times, so I wanted to see what the book was like. I really enjoyed it. I am glad my Kindle has a dictionary so I could really appreciate the story.	4
I've wanted to read this book since I saw the movie. It's such a charming book. I adore dear Lizzie and her character.	5
this is my desert island book - my favourite of all time. I have read it over and over again and it never ceases to entertain	5
I am about 75% of the way through this book and can say it is enjoyable, even for a guy.	4
I know, almost everyone has read the book, but in case people are looking for a free book and haven't read this one and are considering it, READ IT!!! It's amazing! Jane Austin captures your heartstrings and never lets go. Still swooning.	5
I just love the book love the caracters and the review the writer gives on each one in her own way	5
If you like classical books then you will adore this one. pride And prejudice is an astonishing book full of the full wrath of Jane Austin's romance.	5
Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice gets better with each read because there are so many hidden character traits and character development that you can't possibly catch in one read. Everyone should read at the very least Pride and Prejudice!	5
Thank you its in great shape and it sounds Good I love it!I use it all the time on my phone.Deborah	4
The book had all the words in it, some might have been missing, but if they were, I didn't notice. Perfect for drooling on. Ni-i-ice.	5
Its one of the greatest novels ever written in the english language, and every time I read it is like reading it for the first time. So brilliant it almost hurts	5
After having seen the Colin Firth movie version so many times, I was excited to start reading the book. I was not disappointed in the least. Romance in a pure form - I hated to see it end!	5
I read the Jane Austen books about once every 5 years. I never fail to love them. Excellent writting, great character development and a wonderful story.	5
love story --classic ----All must be read and enjoy the Jane Austin collections. You can also enjoy the movie versions.	4
Its seems churlish to proffer a critique of Jane Austen when she is so widely regarded as the literary doyenne of her era. However the book is so different (and superior) to the dramatisations of it that the read is like discovering yet another book. I admire her command of the English language and her ability to convey so many nuances in such beautifully written prose. Unique and brilliant	5
Anything by Austen is a must-read and P&P is the best of all. Her manner of capturing the nuances, foibles, and speech of her characters make them come alive and ensure that this book will continue to be a classic in any era.	5
Chivilary and romance all rolled up into a very tantilizing story of sister looking for the right man to sweep them off their feet. Lost romance and misunderstood relationships and how to indure the pain.	5
Enjoyed the book very much. The characters were well described .This was a book club selection and I will probably read more of her books in the future, time permitting.	5
Once I got back into Jan Austen's narrative style, I enjoyed the book as much as I had when I read it many years ago.	5
Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite novels of all time, and certainly one of my favorite Jane Austen novels, though I have to say, my favorite is Persuasion. In any case, this book is great and priceless. It is a timeless romance, I love it.	5
Pride & Prejudice is of course a classic in English literature, so in itself it needs no review. However, I want to compliment Amazon for its free library of such titles. That people can access them simply and at no or next to no cost if a real benefit!	4
There is so much to write positively about the charm of this book. However, I find the most delight I receive is in the clever phrases and word usages. It is a kind, long poem to my ears.Naturally, I do like Elizabeth as well. She is very human. She has the ability to make mistakes, to learn from them, and to realize her hubrus and change. I don't find this very often in modern works.I return to this book from time to time to retreat from life. It has become an old soothing friend to me!	5
Excellent reading, I have read this book many years ago and will probably read it again in the future, great book.	5
Jane Austin always presents an opportunity of visiting old English life. Revisiting Pride and Prejudice was a relaxing occupation and I recommend the book to any one who likes a "clean" read, i.e. no nasty language and no sexual descriptions.	5
An absolute favorite! I love being able to take this with me where ever I go with out carrying the book with me.	5
Pride And Prejudice, Jane Austen(This review was originally published at The Brazen Broads' Book Bash)A Timeless Classic...For anyone who has never read Pride And Prejudice, this Broad would urge you to crack the cover! If you enjoy a smart romance, sharp wit, and the humor of peering into the character flaws of those about you, you won't be disappointed. Austen wrote my favorite heroine of all time within the pages of this novel. Elizabeth Bennet absolutely steals the show!The Bennet sisters, under the hand of an often dramatic and obnoxiously silly mother and a father, who abounds with dry humor but mostly abdicates his role, face life, society, and courtship in the English countryside. This is no easy task, for the young women have no considerable wealth or lofty position to aid them in a time when that was quite important.Pride And Prejudice chronicles the romantic fiascoes of the Bennet girls. Jane, the eldest sister, wins the love of the young and well-to-do Mr. Bingley, although certainly not without trial and tribulation. But jealousy and interference leave her happiness in serious doubt. Lydia, the middle child, selfish and flighty, refuses to comply with propriety, and her actions threaten the chances of all the sisters. The two youngest, Mary and Kitty, while affected by the goings-on, don't figure as prominently in the story. This leaves Elizabeth, the novel's main female character, to entertain with her bold wit and keen observations during her own adventures in life and love.When Elizabeth Bennet first encounters Mr. Darcy, she at once understands him to be prideful and ill-mannered, founding her long lasting prejudice. Adding to her less than friendly impressions are the accusations against Mr. Darcy by the family's newest acquaintance, Mr. Wickham. Circumstances, however, continue to throw the two together, and the time spent coming to know Elizabeth begins to alter Mr. Darcy's opinions. His change in behavior leaves much to be desired, and it isn't until after Elizabeth's scathing face-to-face assessment of Mr. Darcy's character flaws that he confronts his pride whole-heartedly, and Elizabeth faces her prejudice.Strength of character, probing dialogue, and honest reflection turn their opinions of one another into something altogether different as Elizabeth and Darcy, each in their own way, dare to break with convention and hope in love.After reading Austen's original again, I am more than eager to dive into the first sequel on my list! Reading the varied takes on what the Darcy's love affair may have looked like once they married intrigues me to no end.~Moira	5
I'm slightly embarrassed to say that it took me this long to get around to reading Pride & Prejudice. I don't like romance novels and I'm generally wary of anything that is too popular. And yet here I am, giving P&P one of the few 5-star ratings I've ever bestowed. Jane Austen is, without a doubt, among the wittiest, cleverest, most talented authors I've ever read. I laughed out loud repeatedly, thoroughly enjoyed many of the characters (the protagonists were refreshingly frank and the stupid ones were delightfully annoying), and don't you tell anyone but I had tears in my eyes when Darcy and Elizabeth finally sorted things out. I'll be thinking about this book for a long time, and I imagine that I'll be delving into Austen's other books in short order.	5
Pride and Prejudice is an amazing classic. Those who have seen the movie...READ THE BOOK! Austen does a wonderful job in her character development and capturing the emotions and making them tangible. I don't think I have ever enjoyed a classic more and I hope to endulge in many more.	5
I understand that classics have their worth, but most of them bore me. Pride and Prejudice, however, is one of the few lit peices that makes me smile and want to finish it.This book is free on Kindle-- there's absolutely no reason not to download it and give it a chance.	4
This book is a must read for every one! Beautiflly written, and the narrative as unique as the author herself.	5
Beautifully written from start to finish. The story captures all of your attention as it slowly unfolds. I get lost in all of the beautiful words. Highly recommend to strong and romantic women and men alike.	5
I personally enjoyed the book. A little slow at first but other than that a classic. It is one of those books that should be read just to have in the archive for reference.	4
~3.5/5[Also available on my blog.]I think I'm going to try and keep this review short, just for the fact that I don't have as high, or much, of an opinion as most people do. But I might have more to say than I think.This is my first Jane Austen book, and, while I'd wanted to read it for a while, the main reason I finally got around to it, was because of The Lizzie Bennet Diaries. Which, if you aren't watching those, whether you've read the book or not, you should. It's... simply amazing. I love it.But I'm talking about the book, so let me get back to that.When I started the book, I was afraid it was going to be long and droning and boring, given the time period it was written, and it kind of was, in parts. There were a lot of dry parts in this book, a lot of slow points, and the language was rather boring at some points. There were long sentences, huge paragraphs, not nearly as much dialogue, and sometimes it was a bit hard for me to follow. There were, though, some scenes, some chapters or plots, that I really enjoyed, and those went by really fast, whereas other ones took way too long to get through.My main annoyance with the writing was how tell and not show it was. There were countless times that the reader would be told about something that had happened, some scene we didn't get to see, and sometimes even some kind of characteristic that a character had. And the one reason I'm even a little okay with those things is that, with the characters, it was made apparent in their attitude that what we were told was true, and with the scenes, if we were shown them, the book would have been longer, and I probably wouldn't have enjoyed that. It still annoyed me, though; is probably the thing I least liked about this book.Next, the characters. I liked Elizabeth enough, I suppose, but didn't really care too much about her either way. The same with most of the characters, actually. I liked Mr. Bennet. I liked the romantic relationships. I wasn't too big a fan of Bingley, most of the time, because he just seemed too prideful and full of himself (which I will talk about again in a minute). I didn't think I got to know Lydia very well. Jane seemed alright. I didn't like Caroline, because she was... not a nice person.I liked Darcy at first, but then later on was kind of iffy about him. I knew what was going to happen with him and Lizzy, but somewhere in the middle, his attitude bothered me. I think it just seemed like too big a jump, from him being standoffish to really nice to her. But, thinking back on it, it wasn't too bad, actually. I did like their relationship, so there's that.Now, the pride thing. After reading the book, I understand what the title means, and I'm kind of okay with it. I don't mind the prejudiced thing. But the pride part just annoyed me so much. All of the characters were prideful about one thing or another. Bingley was rather full of himself. As was Darcy. And I just... I guess I feel like some development should have been done there, instead of it just continuing to be that way. They aren't the only characters that were prideful, a lot of them were, but they just made the biggest impression on me.I think that's all I have to say, really. The book wasn't horrible, even if it was droning and boring at times, and had way too much telling. The rating is really so high because of the story line. The plot was good, what with what happened with Lydia, and Jane's change in attitude halfway through, and the ending, and even how some of the characters acted. There were some parts that I really enjoyed.I don't plan on reading any of Austen's other books, though. I do plan on watching some of the Pride and Prejudice movies, and am at the moment watching the miniseries, but that might take a while. They're just so long, and kind of boring to me. I know that most people love this book, though, so don't take my word on it all.I would suggest watching the web series The Lizzie Bennet Diaries, though, because it is amazing, and I honestly think it's better than the book.	4
Loved this book, I have lost count of how many times I've read this book. This is my go to book, for a good dose of true romance.	5
I loved this book. If would have read it in high school I would never have understood it or appreciated it as much as I did now.	5
This book is undeniably a great love story that warms your heart. It is very entertaining and full of rich and gratifying literature for the soul.	5
In my opinion, Pride and the Prejudice is a work of art.From a teens point of view its quite beautiful. That leaves you in tears. Some might say its in a old time theme, but I would like to think the romance in this story is so typical every 2000 kinda day. We live in a world where men and women play the "I don't like you card." Even when we have already fallen for that person. Instead of realizing right of the bat they were meant to be. Anyway, if you're looking for a nail biter, empty box of tissues, this is an amazing book. Don't over look it because of the title or date written. It's really a piece of art it's self.	5
Having seen the film and I think I have read the book before too, this reading absolutely took me into romantic bliss. Well worth the reread and I think I'll wait a bit before the next reading. But I will read it again. Recommended for anyone who has a slight romantic bone in their body.	5
Love, love, love this book, I have read it so many times, it just takes you back through a time portal	5
This is a book I have read at least 2 or 3 times before ; If you are a fan of Jane Austen you know what I mean!She is so talented and clever in her writing ,you never tire of it !The proof of a classic is never having to use sex scenes or foul words to get the story across .;If you long to daydream of a gentle time ! You will love Jane Austn !	5
Read it!!!!!If I can read this book(comming from a girl who doesn't read at all) you can read it.	5
Wonderful! It had been 30 years since I first read Pride and Prejudice. I have in recent years gotten into reading the P&P variations and I love them. Nothing beats the original though.	5
There is nothing to be said said about Pride and Prejudice that had not already been said. It truly is one of the best books ever written.	5
I enjoyed revisiting this novel which I read as a teen. The language was especially engaging. I recommend it to lovers of Victorian English.	5
I love Pride and Prejudice. I love Jane Austen and I simply wanted to add another 5 star review to this free version for it's awesomeness.Cheers.	5
It was a good book, I like the story line, but I'm not a big fan of the 18th Century English language, I found it very hard to understand some of the statments that the character were making, I had to reread them several times.This was a assignment for class, is really the only reason I read it, but I did enjoy.	3
This was my second reading of the book and just like some new dish I find something new to like each time. I love this story!!!	5
My only regret in reading this piece is my decision to delay it so long in life. The language is lively, the attention it commands is constant, and the parallels that can be drawn across time hold true.	5
I have seen parts of the movie but never the entire story so it was enjoyed. Some sections were a little extra explanatory but overall well written and enjoyed.	5
The book was a great read- I hardly put it down for the 4 days I spent reading it. It does differ from the movie in that Mr. Darcy really was haughty and prideful in the beginning instead of merely misunderstood, and Elizabeth Bennett was prejudiced, but both of course reconciled and became better people for each others' accusations. Also, there were a couple additional characters and some of the dialogue was switched between characters, which made more sense than even in the more recent version of the film. There was one notation at the closing of every (mailed) letter that I did not understand, but otherwise did not see many mistakes that would not have been in the original manuscript as other reviews reported. I thoroughly enjoyed the book.	5
After reading so many modern fiction popular titles it is so refreshing to go back to a classic. Pride and Prejudice really is at the top of my classic favs list.	5
I am mad that I put off reading this book for so long. I absolutely loved the story, the characters, just everything about it. I couldn't put it down and was sad when it ended. The progression of Elizabeth's and Mr. Darcy's relationship and love was beautiful. The family dynamics of the Bennetts was so real. Amazing story, beautifully written.	5
I have, to this point in my life, successfully avoided reading any Jane Austen books, supposing them to be superfluous and archaic. I really only read this book because I wanted the foundation and familiarity with the story prior to reading the adaptation entitled ''Pride and Prejudice and Zombies'' by Seth Grahame-Smith. Because who can pass up a good zombie book, after all?I started this book begrudgingly but was soon intrigued by the language. I amused myself by reading aloud a paragraph of flowery language to my husband and then paraphrasing it in a sentence. I proclaimed and bemoaned the inefficiency of the writing style but persevered and slogged on. About halfway through the book, I surprised myself by really wanting to know what happened next. And here I sit, 1am in the morning, having to finish the book tonight with the absolute stubbornness of having to know Elizabeth's disposition!Hands down, I loved this book. Shame on me and my ignorance for Ms. Austen's talent. I hope to read many more of her books. After I read the zombie version of 'Pride and Prejudice'. :)	5
My English master at school made us read P&P out loud and we did enjoy it but I still have no idea why. Since then I have read it many times but still can't put my finger on the reason that it is so good. One of the problems is that we have all seen the TV adaptation and the movies especially with that background music. I recently read it out loud to a class of school children in Africa and they were captivated. But why?	5
This tale is a classic, and for good reason. It has managed to stand the test of time and even after so many generations, Jane Austen is still able to capture your heart and pull you into this charming, little world and endear you to her lovable, fleshed out characters. It's witty, heart-warming, funny, filled with wonderful life lessons and just an overall fun read. Easily one of my favorites books of all time!	5
Love how beautifully published this edition is. It is still a favorite of mine, after all these years. I try to read it once a year or every other year, at the very least. Always find something new each time I revisit it. Thank you Jane Austen for paving the way for future female writers..........Jane Austen: The Compete Works (Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park, Emma, Northanger Abbey, Persuasion, Lady Susan & more!)	5
This is my favorite book ever! I've read it many times and will continue to read it for the rest of my life. It never gets old or boring and it's free for the Kindle! So you can't beat that.	5
This book is the BEST love story i have ever read in my life... aand i read a lot. The plot in this romance is so unexpected you cant help but to feel such happiness after reading it!! It really is just an adorable story with a stunning storyline!!-B. Br@ndt	5
This is my first true classic to read and am in awe at how the story still holds up almost 200 years after it was originally written. Beautiful love story!	5
Beautiful story, wonderfully written. I recommend it and I believe everyone should read it st least once. I am glad I did.	5
My sister recommended this book, so purchased it and couldn't get past chapter 6. Between the writing style, language & amount of characters thrown at you...I gave up. Not my sort of novel or subject.	3
Can you ever get enough of Jane Austen? I love having this on my kindle so that I may read it whenever I lie, where ever I am.This is not a book to be read only once.	5
This is one of my all time favorite reads! While the story comes to a predictable end, the journey to it is such a pleasure that I have reread and written down passages that will probably stay with me forever.	5
Classic Jane Austen at work. Already have the paperbook addition but is definitely a &#34;must have&#34; for my electronic reading collection.....never know when you're going to get stuck somewhere or the urge for a classic read ivercomes you!!!	4
One of those old classic. One must simply have on ones book case and have read it at least once in there life.	4
I am the proud owner of the Kindle. It has allowed me to buy many books and read them easily. I love the story about the Bennetts as written by Jane Austen.	5
Love. Such a classic story, reading on kindle was seamless and easy. Would recommend this book on this device to people.	5
Excellent Book!!!! Great read for the holidays--Jane Austen knows how to tell a love story/ Order it now for some reading pleasure.	5
this is a wonderful book and i remember reading the paperback years ago. the best part? its a free download!	5
One of my favorite classics. I have watched the movie, too, many times. Such a true reflection of life and how we are as a people. So proud we miss opportunities.	5
everyone in the world knows who Mr. Bingly is. and if not u should get this free book for the kindle. u cant find men like this now a days. i know we all wish we could. Elisabeth. Jane, Mr Darcy.. what more can i say.	5
It is a classic and rightly so. Probably the original chick book. So much dialogue and focus on relationships between people. I thought it was very well written and certain key quotes caught my eye. Overall, a joy not a pain to read for my literature class.	5
I downloaded this as my first book on my new Kindle. Classic Austen, good font for the Kindle, phenomenal story line. If you love romance and haven't read this quintessential book - what are you waiting for?	5
There is a reason this book has been around for 200 years. Its tale of human nature. Is timeless. The tale of love and miss understanding is equally timeless.	5
great classic and great to have in e-reader form to take with me on trips or anywere i may go by far one of my favorite books	5
a classic. I love it! I always want to read it iver & over but can never find the book lying around home. Thanks Kindle	5
Ok book. Movie was better and easier to follow on than the books. Liked the characters in the movie better than those in the book,.	3
The book is slow, takes a lot of time in details that I supposed where very important for the time, but for me they are not. I just think if your are looking for historic novels you can find something better. If you're looking for a love story very romantic and classic, I supposed this is the right one; I have to say that all my girlfriends love it... so I supposed it can be very enjoyable for some kind of people, not for pragmatic people like me.	3
Ok, I'll admit, I found Ms. Austen's wordiness painful for about 80% of the novel, at which point, I got caught up in the love story, and enjoyed the remainder of the book!	4
I was very very disappointed when I downloaded this book for my Kindle. According to Amazon customer service, there is no way to tell if any of the free Kindle editions of books are abridged before you download them. In this case, the book is clearly abridged, and it is a very poorly done abridgment. Hopefully, the paid versions of this book for Kindle are not abridged.	1
The construction of the story and the storytelling are wonderful. It is a page-turner even though I know how it ends. I wish to find its equivalent in contemporary literature.	5
Pride and Prejudice is a great book full of love, scandal, humor, wit, and drama. Whether you are young or old, I am positive that this novel has an aspect of interest that will catch your attention right away. Set in an 18th century English society, Jane Austen does a fantastic job of adding comic relief and wit to a society where men have almost ultimate control. The estate of the Bennet family is entailed to Mr. Collins, so the five Bennet daughters must find suitable husbands if they wish to have a home or property in the future. The book revolves around conversation and thoughts the characters have about each other. Austen never gives a complete physical description of the characters, so the reader is left to make an opinion on each character based on their first impression of them. This style of diction and syntax eventually leads to the discovery of a major theme: do not always trust your first impression of someone. Irony is another common device Austen used in the novel. The Bennet's second daughter, Elizabeth, and Mr. Darcy end up falling for each other despite every obstacle that was thrown at them. Problems with social status, money, Mr. Darcy's pride, and Elizabeth's refusal to settle on a man caused drama in the beginning stages in their relationship. The novel's ending proved that one should not judge a person on a first impression and that true love truly can conquer all. Those facts will always make to novel relevant to current times, contrary to those who call the novel out of date. Read this novel and fall in love!	5
The diction and the story line of the novel is so amazing, The Darcy/Elizabeth chemistry is amazing and great for any romantic reader.	5
Great read, and the plot is just so easy to follow, the romance and wit is what sealed the deal for me.	5
Brainy sophisticated and hilarious. A great read! Very interesting and you are entertained by Elizabeth and Darcy the entire novel.	5
What a great love story!Austen did a amazing job I only wish she continued to tell more about Elizabeth's life after the marriage!	4
This book is the best ever. It's a classic that can still be related to today. It's absolutely beautiful and bound to be a favorite of whomever reads it.	5
Reading this book for the second time although enjoying if immensely more the second being of my own choice. Really a splendid author describing quite effectively lively characters.	5
a fun book once you got used to the language it was impossible to put down. I highly recommend it!	5
As I find with most "classics" this novel took some time to completely capture my interest. Once it did, however, I was completely enchanted. Our 21st century need for speed and immediate gratification takes a backseat as we move with Jane Austen through the every day lives and loves of her characters. The slow but steady pace of the novel allows the time to actually get to know and connect with the characters. Austen brings you fully into her world of 19th century England: with no difficulty you can feel the joys and sorrows, happiness and tribulations of the Bennet sisters and especially Elizabeth and Jane.Classic themes: scheming mothers, class distinctions, vanity, pride,false assumptions and misunderstandings abound...until by the novel's conclusion I could not help but find myself rooting for Elizabeth and Darcy.I thoroughly recommend this to anyone who loves classics and doesn't mind the slow pace that generally characterizes them.	4
Adopted the thrift edition of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice to reduce the textbook expenses for a college-level literature class. No, the book isn't like the movie and doesn't have a fancy cover, but the book is genuine Austen whose text is rich in Regency romance in an affordable format.	5
This book is great and I love Jane Austen, only the letters were too small, in fact I took the time to campare with other books and no one had so little letters. Even if you don't need tp wear glasses I think they could be larger to make the reader comfortable.	4
I heard a bunch of good things about this book and avoided it for a while. I missed out on a lot so I decided to read the book anyways, even though I had heard too much about it and I would have to say, even though I knew the ending of the book, I still really liked reading the book and definitely found myself wondering what might happen in the next chapter so the book still kept me in suspense. I'm not really a big reader, I read books whenever I was in the mood, plus I had seen the movie prior to reading the book, but friends who had read the book said	4
There is nothing else I can say that has not already been said on the positive reviews on here. Great work!	5
This, probaly Jane Austen's most famous book, is on every list as one of the most important books of literature in the world. As such, it is an essential read for everyman.	4
I'm not really a big reader, I read books whenever I have time, plus I had seen the movie prior to reading the book, but friends who had read the book said I missed out on a lot so I decided to read the book anyways...and I would have to say, even though I knew the ending of the book, I still really enjoyed reading the book and definitely found myself wondering what might happen in the next chapter so the book still kept me in suspense.	5
What else I can say? Pride and Prejudice is classic. This specific one is for collection. The paper is clean and especially smooth.	5
I downloaded this on Kindle for Blackberry. Let me tell you, when I was required to read this in the middle of the school year, I did not think I would be this addicted. I was so happy to find out that Amazon had this for free so I immediately downloaded it. I read this book on my phone every morning and every afternoon. I actually don't mind the rest of the techs as long as I didn't have to flip through pages on the subway.	5
Pride and Prejudice is Austen's second,most well know,and my favorite novel.The story starts when a rich young man named Mr. Bingley rents a house in the neighborhood. Mrs.Bennet has five daughters and is hoping that Mr.Bingley will fall in love and marry one of them.Mr.Bingley and her eldest daughter the beautiful sweet Jane seem to strike up an attachment.When Bingley's best friend Mr.Darcy,a proud gentlemen and Mrs.Bennet's second oldest daughter a playful witty girl named Eliazbeth(the main character)meet lets just say Elizabeth thinks Darcy is the most disagreeable man she has ever meet.Including some of Austen's most memorable characters:Mrs.Bennet and her husband Mr.Bennet(the father of dry wit)make one of the funniest,unhappily married couples in history,and Mr.Collins(one of the suitors)is the model of everything a girl doesn't want in a guy.I love Elizabeth and Mr.Darcy.They have some of the most bewitching conversations and never has Austen's ear for dialogue been better then in her second novel.I was charmed by Pride and Prejudice and hope you will be too.	5
This is my favorite book, i have read it many times over and every time i get sucked into it unable to put it down. I am not a big fan of other period classics as such but there's something about Lizzy and Mr Darcy that get me every time.	5
Great story!!! Jane Austen is surely one of my favorite authors; she creates stories and characters readers can easily get caught up with. One of my all-time favorites!	5
The love story of Elizabeth and Darcy is like an old friend. Even if you have not read it in years, you can pick up without missing a beat.	5
Its a loved classic, I can read this book over and over! I stayed interested through the whole story. Love it!	5
The movies are great, but you need to read this classic to really enjoy Lizzy and Darcy's story. Easy read.	5
When I need comfort, I turn to Pride and Prejudice. Elizabeth Bennett is one of my personal heroes, and Darcy is an excellent match for her.The first time I read it--when I was 17--I was keenly aware of the brilliant comedy in the book. As I re-read it again and again over the years, it still makes me laugh, but it also makes me think of Jane Austen herself, and how a woman whose life was so circumscribed by her circumstances could manage to create such an astonishing array of characters, with such depth.Don't miss it. And for goodness sake, DON'T CALL IT A ROMANCE! It's a comedy of manners.	5
I like to read and I try to catch up on the classics. I purchased this book because I knew it was considered a classic, but I couldn't get into it and put it down before finishing the second chapter. It's not for men.	2
This is a classic English literature, so it has a fairly complex vocabulary and indirect way of communicating that is not quick to read. I certainly expanded my own vocabulary in reading it. The story itself has sufficient twists and turns to be quite enjoyable.I definitely enjoyed this story. (And you can share it with the kids, as there's no sex or profanity in it. Whether they'll understand the nuances of phrase or not is a separate question...)	5
I have never read this classic before, but love the movie.This book was excellent, I would recommend it to everyone!	5
Great book to read if in need of romantic indulgent!!! I love this book and I would and have read it over and over again....	5
Loved it in hardcover and in paper back. Love it even more in e-book. The characters are as real today as in the Austen era.	5
THis book is a classic and is a must read for all literature fans. Definitely a long more difficult read compared to modern literature - but that's the point right!	3
Wonderful story and loved all the &#34;proper&#34; behavior along with the secret thoughts of a young girl back in the 19th Century. When marriage was the main course for unmarried ladies and how involved the entire family became in order to strive for that objective. I have wanted to read this work for a long time after becoming interested in 19th Century classics, I wasn't disappointed. Lizzie being so bright and level headed was refreshing in comparison to her younger sisters and even with her older sister Jane, the kindest one. The one character, Mr. Darcy was hard to understand his aloofness to the point of being extremely rude just didn't seem to fit at first meeting since later in the book he showed himself to be so totally compassionate and sensitive to Lizzie's trouble's with her younger sister's plight. All's well that end's well, loved the book.	5
This is a chic book, but I do enjoy reading it and seeing how the author develops the characters and the plots. Have read it about 5 times and frequently go back to sections.	4
It was a pleasant read. I have always wanted to read it and I finally found the time. I am happy that I did.	5
I had always wanted to read this especially after seeing the movie. I love to see how the screenwriters either kept to the story or alters it in some ways.	5
I knew this book was a classic, but never read it until now. I enjoyed the story, it ended too soon.	4
Enjoyed reading this classic story! I would recommend this to anyone, especially those who love reading about the prescense of mind of those from historical eras.	4
Very well written love story and an interesting study of human nature. Probably of more interest to women than men.	5
An entertaining look into the always turbulent and never direct course of courtship and marriage; it is well worth reading over and over again.	5
I dont know what shall I say about it, I am in love with this book. I am sure everyone knows Mr. Darcy but you should read the book before you see the movie	5
Jane creates a colorful cast of characters to people this moral tale of hasty judgement. As always her heroine must suffer mistakes on her part and bear the frailties of others to find happiness.	4
Pride and prejudice is a moving rmance story depicting well the class societ of England and how in the end love prevails over class restraints; pride and individual prejudices. This book causes deep introspection of one's values; beliefs and mores.	4
I read &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34; when I was in college and thought it was an awful bore! I decided to re-read it and am I glad I did. I have a much greater appreciation for Jane Austen now than I did as an 18 year old. I am sure I will re-read it again in a few years......	5
Good acting, a good story, stuck pretty close to the novel and I appreciated the subtitles since I'm hearing impaired.	5
My resolution is to read more classic literature. I love this book so I decided to start with a book I had read a long time ago. Once I ordered the book, I got it immediately. The service is exceptional..	5
I like Pride & Prejudice, I like this edition! Hugh Thomson illustrations displayed very clearly on the screen of my kindle!	5
If you like the classics, you will love this. Wit, drama, and comedy. Amazing.However, if you don't like the classics, you may find the language difficult to get into at first, but I believe you will soon fall in love with these characters.	5
Jane Austen is one of my favorite authors along with the Brontes. Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite books.	5
I loved the story and all of the characters were so relatable. My favorite though was Mr. Bennett. He was hilarious with his sarcasm and dry humor.	4
I had wanted to read this book for quite some time now, and I'm glad I finally got the chance to. It is a good piece, which I very much enjoyed. For me, it didn't totally live up to my expectations of it, but I found it very enjoyable to read. And I can't wait to read more of Jane Austen's books...	4
A classic novel depicting the motives and manipulations of people. Really enjoyed it! Had a hard time putting it down.	5
This is probably my favorite book ever. I don't know how many times I've read it, but I love it more every time I read it.	5
This book is classic. Beautifully written, and I love the story. The small paperback book is very wordy and challenging to read, as all the text is small and compact, but it's worth the effort--and spared weight!	5
I think this a great book. I have probably read this book 3 times. Just everyone says, &#34;It is a classic.&#34;	5
Have always wanted to read this and finally doing it. I am only about 20% into it but am enjoying it and finding it hard to put down. Had seen the movie but as in all movies the book fills in the gaps! Definitely recommend: A good insight to English life style along with a good read.	5
The only way to describe this book and it's characters is literary perfection. Leaves me with a smile on my face. Every girl must read this book.	5
This book is romantic and comical. A great look at that period in time through the eyes of a family living the experiences.	5
This is a classic book ofLiterature that demonstrates the tenacious plight of a 19th century heroine determined to not settle for anything other than true love. This demonstrates the helpless nature of women in a society dominated by men. Jane Austin is masterful in her craft.	5
Always been a favourite of mine and I still love it. Was the first e-book I've read and I found it convenient.	5
I am a new Amazon user. I purchased a beloved classic to start my Kindle experience. This edition is a fraud, unreadable. Photocopied bits and pieces, a sham. Let the buyer beware.	1
ok this book was very good.I loved the movie and now I love the book!!!This is a romance story and in some parts its funny!!If u r looking for a book to read on a rainy day or maybe in the sun this is your book.	4
Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a classic story about a girl named Elizabeth Bennet, one of five sisters as she unknowingly makes an arrogant Mr. Darcy fall in love with her. While her older sister, Jane, has her own troubles with Mr. Darcy's friend, Mr. Bingley.This is a love stories for more than one, full of marriage do's and don'ts. It is also full of wonderful dialogue and a timeless plot.This is one of my very favorite books. I love how everything that could possibly go wrong does go wrong. My favorite part about it is that I can relate to the story although it obviously was not written in this time period.My favorite mix up is how Mr. Darcy is convinced that Jane does not love Mr. Bingley so he separates them, causing Elizabeth to refuse his offer of marriage. He then goes through a long process of tiny deeds with the hope of redeeming himself in Elizabeth's eyes.One of my favorite characters is Mrs. Bennett. Forever causing her daughters' grief with her thoughtless comments and impropriety, she contributes to much of her daughters' unhappiness; Although all she wants for them is to be well-married and happy.I recommend this book with a love for classics who do not get bored with a lot of dialogue (like my sisters do).E @ 3 Book BeesOriginally posted @ [...]Ima swagbucks superstar @ [...]	5
A good book and a very interest romance. An history to put in your heart and in your life. Fantastic.	4
Good book lots of features i like the characters and the setting of the story i thought it was awsome to read and it had great imageination	5
While "Pride and Prejudice" itself needs no review, since it's the best loved romance novel of all time, it's nice to have it available in a format my telephone based reader can handle. Now, even in the can, I'll never be without refined reading material!	5
This work brings each character into such clear focus that real- life names come to mind. Very enjoyable and enjoyable.	5
I read this after watching the movie about 10 times and I was not disappointed. More detail and better understanding of their feelings and the characters in the book. I really enjoyed it.	5
Fell in love with this novel when I had to read it for introduction to fiction class. Even though the novel lacks the description of nature, it enables one to feel rural England with its green meadows and fields. The plot is basically a soap opera but it is simply fun to read and see how it develops till it reaches the good end. Therefore, it is a truth univerisally acknowledged that the lovel of great literature must be in want of reading this book :).	5
a wonderful book,so hard to put down. A true English classic that is hopelessly romanticWould definitely recommend this book	5
I actually had bought this book but didn't immediately read it. It wasn't until I had to watch the 2005 movie for my Women in Literature class that I fell in love with it. I quickly started reading this book and couldn't believe I waited so long. It is definitely one of my all time favorite books.	5
Jane Austen is a true master. Her characters and phrasing linger long after the book has been set aside. Austen should be required reading for all.	5
I don't know how many times I've read this novel. Lately, I've listened to it on audio books and read along every evening. Sometimes I would jump ahead and then re-read that section. It was so fun...I know it sounds a little odd. I bought a used copy because I have several others, unfound upon quick glance, scattered about the house. Nice, comfortable copy.	4
a classic book where there is really nothing bad to say about. AS an adult though one can appreciate it more because we choose to read the book instead of it being an assignment that needs to be completed for school.	5
The plot is good...but they don't tell you what each character is thinking, the don't give you an insight into each person real personality	3
As always this is an amazing book but this version was a pit disappointing. Certain words were left out which would make it hard for someone who has never read the book. For someone who is familiar with the book this isn't a huge issue especially since its free.	3
I needed to have a copy of P & P for a class. The eBook makes it so much easier! Great price and you have the book in just the amount of time it takes to download. Couldn't be happier.	4
I wanted to read a classic and with my new Kindle Fire, I did just that. I enjoyed the story and will read more by Jane Austen.	5
Ms. Austen's book revenues will not be affected by anything I have to say about this book, it seems silly to write a review. It is also beyond my skills to praise it adequately. Just read it- now.	5
Great book. Can't go wrong with a classic book. Love the kindle addition. Can read on kindle and my phone.	5
It's a beautiful story and a great title: the first part, our hero, Elizabeth, fights with what she thinks is the pride of Mr. Darcy. Then, when she discovers he's a gentleman with a very strong personality, she has to turn al her prejudices against him on his favor. It's a beautiful story.	5
It was very interesting. There were parts when I didn't want to stop reading. I loved it very much so.	5
A classic book that everyone should take the time to read. Have to get used to the different ideas & manner of speaking but was very heartwarming.	4
love this book i keep reading it over and over again love jane austen it depicts the trials and tribulations of finding love in those ages	5
A wonderful tale that shows the importance of upbringing , character and morality. Ms. Bennet deals with the issues central to life in the 19th century; manners, education and marriage. Ms. Bennet and Mr. Darcy allow us to hope that there is hope through love and understanding.	5
WHAT IS THERE TO SAY ABOUT A CLASSIC. I LOVE THE LANGUAGE, THE MANNERS AND THE RULES OF SOCIAL LIFE. IT'S SO DIFFERENT FROM TODAY'S SOCIETY THAT IT'S LIKE VISITING A FOREIGN COUNTRY IN ANOTHER AGE WHICH IS PRECISELY WHAT THE BOOK IS ABOUT. A GOOD GETAWAY FROM NORMALITY IN THE 21ST CENTURY.	5
I cna't believe that I hadn't read this before. I really enjoyed it. I will be reading more Jane Austin in the future.	5
How can one describe Pride and Prejudice in a few words? Impossible. This is one of the best novels in the English language, both for style and content. The various movies and TV editions, though excellent and immensely entertaining, do not do the novel justice. All I can say is "Read it."	5
I've read this beautiful novel only three times. A British Prime Minister read it 26. My novel, "The War Less Civil"THE WAR LESS CIVIL, deals with issues Miss Austen would be shocked, and in some cases, horrified by. But never would she fail to understand the unchanging character of the human condition that I wrote about in 19th & 20th century America. Her insights into the human spirit and behavior in the early 1800s, seemingly so simple and commonplace, are as deep as the most profound novelists of any age. If one desires a book offering endless pleasure, one that could be reread once a year for a lifetime, then I strongly urge one to read "Pride and Prejudice."	5
My daughter and I both read this book. She really enjoyed it, more than the movie. I also enjoyed the book, very much.	5
This book is one of my favorites. I have re-read this book at least 12 times. It is a book that never gets old and is great for reading while on vacation.	5
Watched the pbs version of the book then watched the new version of the movie, so I figured I better read the book. The book keeps you entertained as you picture each chapter in your head. Normally when I watch a movie before a book I get disappointed when I get around to reading it, but in this case the book gives a lot of depth to the characters, which makes it one of the few books turned into movies where I would recommend watching the movie first.	5
The print of this book is attractive as is the simple cover. The size is standard but handy so I can put it in a tote or bookbag and have it ready for access whenever I have a spare moment. So far it is sturdy and doesn't look dog-eared even when it's been toted many places.	5
Even if one considers Pride and Prejudice to be a cautionary tale for men to avoid getting caught up in the affairs of women, or with recognition that Austen is truly showing that women have an amazing ability to manipulate men and essentially control their world, one cannot overlook the sheer boredom that reading Pride and Prejudice creates. Set this one aside and pick up The Scarlet Letter if you are looking for a classic worth reading.	2
Read this and many of Jane Austen's other novels as a teenagers. Downloaded this on to my new kindle and was as enchanted as the first time I read it. A classic romantic novel with exquisite characters and reflections on the way of life of that time. Timeless and a must read for the sad romantics amoungst us.	5
I have been reading classics, but this did not rate for me. I read half and stopped. I found it extremely boring, the descriptions went on and on, and the book was hard to read.	2
What makes a book a "classic"? Is it the language? The fame of the author? The date of publication? Or, as my high school English teacher used to say, is a book a classic "because it still says what it needs to say"? In the case of Jane Austen's masterpiece, "Pride and Prejudice", I'd venture that it is all of the above. Though it was one of her first published novels, it's probably her greatest, and features some of the greatest characters ever written in what is quite possibly one of the oldest stories ever told.The plot itself is timeless. The Bennet family of Hertfordshire has five daughters, and with no sons and an estate entailed along the male line, it is important that the girls find good husbands if they don't want to be turned out of their home upon the death of their father. As is common in most families, each child is very different. Jane, the eldest, is quiet and serene, and always sees the good in everyone. Elizabeth is intelligent, while Mary is preachy and a stuck-in-the-mud. Catherine (Kitty) is a follower, and the youngest, Lydia, is an out-of-control flirt. The story begins, rather famously, with the arrival of new neighbors at Netherfield, a home a few miles away. The house has been taken by a young man with a large fortune, and almost immediately, Mrs. Bennet begins scheming that the as-yet-unknown Mr. Bingley will marry one of her daughters - preferably the eldest.As luck would have it, Bingley and Jane hit it off right away. The same cannot be said for Bingley's socially-awkward friend, Mr. Darcy, and Jane's sister Elizabeth. Almost immediately, the two get on each others' nerves, begun with Darcy insulting Lizzie within the hearing range of the latter and continuing as the Bennet family (with the exception of the two eldest) make fools of themselves at every opportunity. When a regiment of soldiers comes to town, Elizabeth is quick to enjoy conversing with a Mr. Wickham, one of Mr. Darcy's least-favorite people, and eagerly believes everything Wickham says about his former childhood friend.Of course, not everything is as it seems. Darcy and Elizabeth continue to meet over the course of the next year, while she is visiting a friend near his aunt's home, and even on his estate at Pemberley. The more they get to know each other, the more they realize they may have been mistaken about one another. And when Lizzie's youngest sister does the unthinkable, the Bennet family's misfortune may end up being the shove Elizabeth and Darcy need.The greatest thing about this book is its characters. Jane Austen was a master of the absurd, and she has captured it beautifully in the obnoxious Mr. Collins, the haughty Lady Catherine deBourgh, the foolish Mrs. Bennet, and so many others. Everyone is drawn to life, and as you are reading it, you realize that, even though the book came out two centuries ago, these are personalities that still exist in all of our lives. The dialogue is witty and to the point, and though the novel is relatively short, the action never lags. There's a reason the 1995 BBC miniseries adaptation clocks in at close to five hours; a LOT happens in this book. With the 200th anniversary of the novel happening this year, it's definitely time to take an enjoyable look back at one of the most famous - and well-loved - books ever written.	5
I had seen the films, and knew what was going to happen. This may be part of what bored me about the book, but I just couldn't bring myself to finish it-- I don't normally quit reading a book either.	2
I started reading this Kindle edition today and was very put off by the ALL CAPS used for emphasis. There's a version of all Jane Austen's books for $1.99, so I bought that and will delete this one. The other version has no formatting for the emphasized words (italics would be good), but better than those all caps that make it feel like I'm reading Price & Prejudice via facebook.	2
I really didn't like this book because it was in the old times and I didn't understand it so yea :)	1
The marriage, property and inheritance laws of the late 18th and early 19th century, by today's standards, can be considered cruelly misogynistic.The Bennett family estate is entailed and, as Mr Bennett's family consists of his wife and five daughters (nary a son in sight), there is a strong likelihood that, when he passes away, the six surviving ladies will be left homeless and with no income or property. Mrs Bennett is deeply concerned with the situation and frantically searches for the expedient solution of the day (marriage to an eligible man of property whose family would provide her daughters with both a home and settlement of a suitable annual stipend for living expenses). On the other hand, Mr Bennett's approach is much more relaxed and he gives the impression that he feels the marriage of his daughters will take care of itself in due course and that all will ultimately turn out for the best.PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, told primarily from the point of view of Elizabeth Bennett, the most sensible daughter in a family of ladies whose general attitude seems to be quite vapid and utterly self-centered, is a story driven not so much by plot as by character development combined with a comedic critique of the issues of early 19th century mores among the landed gentry - manners, upbringing, morality, education, marriage, conventions, etiquette, leisure, societal behaviour and so on. It might be compared to a much more modern equivalent in F Scott Fitzgerald's THE GREAT GATSBY or on a considerably lighter note, television's famous sitcom SEINFELD. The common factor here ... in a background of purely social commentary, nothing of note really happens. The social commentary IS the story!PRIDE AND PREJUDICE has withstood the onslaught of time and remains to this day (and justifiably so) one of the most popular novels in the entire pantheon of English literature.Highly recommended.Paul Weiss	4
I had to read this for school, but I actually turned out liking it. The only downside is that I think it moves along kind of slowly in the beginning, but I would still definitely reccomend it.. It's a classic!	4
Another Classic, but it just drags for me. Of course, I don't think I'm in the target audience Jane Austen had in mind. I attempted to read it, because it came with my Kindle.	1
I am a huge fan of the movie with Greer Garson.The book is so disappointing.I was hoping to be captured and sadly was not.	2
If you are looking for an unabridged version of the book this is most certainly not it. Looks like someone has typed out the dialogue exchanges from the BBC series and filled in their own interpretation of the feelings at times.	3
This has not survived the test of time. While it's easy to see why this was a popular story from the 19th century up to the 1950s, reading it now is like listening to cat negotiating its way out of a tangled quilt cover, amusing yes, but ultimately awful and frustrating.The motivations of the two central characters are purely woeful. I won't spoil anything but you don't want anyone to get the outcomes that they desire, not the protagonists, not the antagonists, no one.I can't say don't read it as it is so very ingrained in the pop culture of today, however I can say you should read the book trying to identify any part of it that wouldn't be made better by the introduction of zombies.	2
One of my all-time favorite classics and a book I have read endlessly and will read many times more, so am delighted to have this on my Kindle as well as having several print copies around. It means I can dip into it any time the mood takes me. And it took me there this weekend so it was great to just curl up and relive the magic.I just love Jane Austen's language, her wry wit and acute social observations. This should be compulsory reading for everyone! What's not to like?	5
This classic book is always a good read, so it was nice to have it conveniently uploaded to my Kindle app so I can read it again.	4
Sigh, I almost feel guilty giving pride and prejudice three stars. I find the book to be boring, i've picked it up a few times but it just doesn't resonate with me. Reasons why: I didn't find reading an account peoples personality traits that interesting and the book doesn't really have any exciting pick-me-ups.This book is like taking a nice ride through a scenic country side, without want of a destination.	3
love it or hate it the book is a classic and call me crazy but im a sucker for some Jane Austen.	4
Perhaps if Jane Austen is alive she would have wrote a book like this one, so readers like me would catch a glimspe on whats's on the mind of Mr. Darcy.	4
Pride and Prejudice by Jane AustenRecently I went on a drive home to California and back. It's about 7 1/2 hours each way (because I actually go the speed limit!!!) and I wanted to try something new while driving. So, I decided to try an audio recording.I found one from my local library of Pride and Prejudice. : Why not go with a classic book for the drive home?So, I listened to Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen.Pride and Prejudice is the story of the Bennet sisters, Elizabeth and Jane. Both are of marriageable age but do not come from the wealthiest of families. However, they live in a time when marriage to someone with wealth is of utmost importance.Since they have no brothers, when their father dies his estate will go to another male relative, as they are unable to inherit.One summer a new family comes to live nearby, and Mrs. Bennet, their mother insists that Mr. Bennet make an acquaintance with Mr. Bingley, the new bachelor who is very wealthy. At a ball one evening he is immediately taken with Jane Bennet who is admittedly beautiful, of a sweet nature, but perhaps below the standard of wealth into which he is expected to marry.But the problem really is his friend, Mr. Darcy. A haughtier more proud man has never existed, and though that same night at the ball many women did not have partners as men were few, Mr. Darcy makes it clear that he thinks pretty negatively of Elizabeth Bennet. He is cold, unfriendly, and seemingly unkind . . .Mrs. Bennet is determined to see her daughters married and encourages Jane and Mr. Bingley, but is desperate to make a match for Elizabeth, including pushing her to accept the proposal of marriage from her most insipid cousin.We follow the story of the Bennet family as others do everything they can to keep Jane and Mr. Bingley apart, and Elizabeth is forced into close proximity with the awful Mr. Darcy repeatedly.Will Jane and Elizabeth ever find true love that others will accept? Or will their less wealthy state be their destruction?Read Pride and Prejudice to find out!This is a total and complete classic. There are over 2 million copies sold worldwide, hundreds of editions, and quite a few different audio recordings, not to mention TV and movie versions of this story.If you haven't actually read Pride and Prejudice you simply must! It's a beautiful, wonderful story full of lively characters with personality oozing from them. Mrs. Bennet is incredibly silly, a trait which seems to have rubbed off thoroughly on several of her daughters. But Jane and Elizabeth took far more after their father with much more sense. It's the story of how pride and prejudice can keep you from truly seeing another's character, and how opinions can change when someone is given a true chance.I highly recommend this book to everyone!5 out of 5 stars!	5
love this book, have always wanted to read it blah, blah, blah, blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah	5
Ships quickly. Item as described. good to use. will recommend it and buy it again in the future if needed.	5
My favorite book, so it is really nice to have it as an E-Book. E-Book's are a really good idea for people on the go.	5
Classic! If you haven't read it in a long time read it again and if you have never read it READ IT!	5
I really enjoy this book and I am glad to have bought it for Kindle. I also bought the paperback version because my teacher did not allow electronics. While I am not in class I use the Kindle version and the pages correlate to the paperback version so I can always match my progress from the ebook to the paperback. For some reason I read the Kindle version much faster and this helps me with bulky reading assignments so this is great for me.	4
This product was in my mailbox and I didn't expect it for another week! Thank you so much guys! The book was in great condition too!	5
I love this classic!! I am glad it is available for electronic reading. I do recommend it to everybody to enjoy.	5
I chose this book because of the author's fame but found I could not relate to it just now. I will try to read this book again, later.	3
I loved this book! I always thought it would be boring, but I found myself laughing out loud, crying, smiling...I couldn't put it down. It was so witty and sweet. It has become my favorite book and I will read it again and again.	5
I love this story. Somewhat challenging to read due to the old English, but such a powerful story none the less.	5
Got a free copy of this with my kindle and even though its taken me almost a year to get around to reading it I'm so glad I did. I fell in love with Elizabeth, Darcy and the whole gang all over again.	5
Good book for females only. I really can't see a male enjoying this book due to the narration of mostly a female.	4
I sooooo love this story, I saw the movie, and I have always been in love with it, I very much loved this book and I recommend this to everybody it is very romantic, very smart, and it has alot of qualities that I very much enjoy.	5
This book is made for everyone!It is hardly ever slow, although some people might not be use to the writing style of that time, and has a delightful, strong lead heroine who never falters in her strength like most female characters now-a-days.So beautifully written and should be in everyone's bookcase	5
Great writer and one of the best observation of human social interaction and capturing the associated emotions.of social interaction. Also, one of the most romantic stories I have ever read.	5
I found the book to be very interesting. It drew me into to story. I would defiantly read it again.	4
I read this book to improve my vocabulary for the ISSE, SSAT or SAT. It has all the perfect words in the tests and with a click of a finger you can find a definition.	3
There are plenty of reviews of Pride and Prejudice, so I'll skip the book review, and just review the format.The move over to Kindle was pretty solid, and this is very readable both on the device and on my phone. Considering lots of free titles have pretty exaggerated formatting errors, or in the case of the play bookstore are direct photo copies of hard copies, this was extremely readable and deserves five stars as a solid port over.	5
PRIDE AND PREJUDICE IS MAGIC!! IT IS WITHOUT A DOUBT ONE OF MY FAVORITES. I TRULY LOVE THE WRITINGS OF JANE AUSTEN.	5
I always loved this story and all the books from Jane Austen. The form that is written, the language, the descriptions are excellent. I say that I really enjoying reading all these books.	5
This is one of the excellent works that has to be studied for chosen words. I have studied it. I have checked all the definitions that I didn't know. She has used rich vocabulary that adds so much. If you don't check the meaning, you will lose on the context of it. You need to think constantly and be alert while reading. Words put weight on the meaning that when you're tired, you might not understand fully what the author has meant. Understanding its meaning gives you so much pleasure.The author states the situation the character is in by finding the perfect word to describe it. The words chosen were so perfectly used in given situations.Some dialogues may seem unnatural of the words spoken. Did people really talk this way? But after getting deeper into her work, you just get used to it like to the commodity in everyday life.I loved in Jane's work the development of the characters. It is extraordinary and so complex. The author has captured in most not an ordinary way of life back then making it in every sense very realistic.The feelings of being modest, shy, and lacking self-confidence when in love were perfectly presented. Readers who look for romance won't be disappointed.	5
I sent my niece this book as a primer for the Jane Austen world. It is easy to read and understand, with a great type face. I recommened it for readers eager to immerse themselves in a simpler yet more complex time.	5
I've read Pride and Prejudice nearly every year for a decade and I have to say the Penguin Classics new clothbound edition is the best read I've had yet! The look and feel of the book is beautiful. It's an extremely gratifying read, a delight for the senses, and the appendix is a wonderful essay by Tony Tanner, the original Penguin Classics edition's introduction. While it is lengthy, it actually doesn't get tedious at all and is highly informative and insightful. The new introduction, while I haven't read it fully yet, I believe will prove to be equally revealing. The notes are well-balanced, neither vague nor overwhelming- I've looked at annotated versions of Pride and Prejudice that sucked all the joy out of the story with notes that covered half of each page! Anyway, this edition is absolutely delightful, and I can't wait to purchase Wuthering Heights and Sense and Sensibility in the same edition, and possibly more.	5
A treasure of a read. I certainly had some negative precognitions regarding this book but slowly these were eroded as were Elizabeth's sentiments and towards the end I was happy with the characters.	5
I re-read this book, at least once a year! i just love how Jane Austin gave true strength and a mind to women in an era where we believed to only be good to have children, she made us so much more. I truly enjoy Elizabeth and Mr.Darcy go in circles about each other, as well as the the girls mother uncanny view on life. A great classic to read over and over.	5
Really enjoyed reading P&P by Jane Austen. The dialogue was relatively easy to follow except for the occasional English coloquialisms and the characters were superbly fleshed out. Her social commentary regarding gender roles was definitely ahead of its time. Did find some text discrepancies/typos(they could have occured during the download, I'm not really sure?)but most enjoyable reading nevertheless. Am planning to read more of the classics.	5
I didn't remember reading this in school so I thought I'd give a try. It was free with my Kindle app. I thoroughly enjoyed it. A very sweet story that had you hoping for a happy ending.	5
I am a huge bookworm and bought this book specifically because of its fabulous cover. The book came in perfect condition and I am a fan of the ribbon attached, which can be used as a bookmark. Such a great book in a chic packaging. Definitely a great addition to the bookshelf :)	5
Anyone who has read Jane Austen before knows that she's a fantastic author. She makes the words "good book" into flesh and blood. This is prime Jane Austen, complete with dry humor and convoluted relationships. The book itself is ok. I bought it from Amazon because I was close to the $25 free shipping rate. But a used Pride and Prejudice anywhere would be fine, as the gems are inside the book, and reading them is the whole point.	5
I have read Pride and Prejudice several times. I think that this is most definitely one of the best novels written in the English language. Jane Austen explores the relationships between different sets of people. At the age of 16, I was never really into the "Classic novels", but when a friend recommended the book, and I saw the movie (which does not do the novel justice), I decided to try. I instantly fell in love with the characters and Jane Austen's works. Elizabeth Bennet is truly an inspiring character as the story is told through her, and her interaction with other characters clearly shows Jane Austen's view on all kinds of love. This is a novel that I would recommend to anyone who loves a good read!	5
I love this book! The romance, the humor, and the characters we can all connect with set this book apart from other classics. Jane Austen was a genius... who doesn't want to be Elizabeth?	5
I love the story of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. It took me awhile to realize the big deal. But after reading the book instead of just watching the movie it makes much more sense.	5
For some reason I had never read this book. It was on our high school reading list but I made another choice. Once you get past the language and immerse yourself in the story I t was hard to put down.	5
Gotta love this classics. Can never go wrong with getting a book by Austen. Excellent writer and plus it was free!	5
This is one of those weird occasions where I actually prefer the movie (the one staring Keira Knightly). I guess she seemed a too dumb for me in the book. But I did like all the details the movie left out	3
This is the first time I read a Jane Austen book. The language is so formidable and lovely at the same time. I was inspired to read Pride and Prejudice because of the 200th anniversary it's writing and now I understand the reasoning behind the long-term love by Austen readers.	5
I was wholly engrossed by the novel. But this particular version of the book purchased for kindle is really bad. Text at some pages are not aligned. It was similar to reading a PDF in kindle. Better to read the book through PDF.	3
Miss Austen is the most dear friend! Oh how we laugh and conspire together! She has given me Mr Darcy, whom all young ladies should have, and she has shown me myself, whom I know better from her dearest Lizzie.	5
This Austen classic is full of wit; you'll notice more and more each time you read it. It really gets better with age!	5
I could read Pride and Prejudice again and again and still enjoy every page. A true classic to be enjoyed	5
I've read this story in hard cover a couple of times, so when I got my Kindle and saw that there was a free version for download, I downloaded it. I downloaded it so that my daughter could read it. My family has the DVD set of Pride and Prejudice Istarring Colin Firth) and they love it, so I wanted my daughter to enjoy the written version. She did! As I said, this is a classic tale for all ages and I highly recommend it.	5
Sometimes the language was hard to understand but it helped to understand the movie better by reading the book. Enjoyed the book	2
Seeing Lizzie struggle with herself and others was well done. Mr. Darcy seemed too cruel to suddenly be so nice. But he was trying to NOT love Lizzie. Fun story, everything tied up in a pretty ribbon in the end.	3
One of my favorite books. The realization of the truth set them free to love. Oh Mr. Darcy, Mr. Darcy, Mr. Darcy!	4
This is my favourite book of all time. It is truly a timeless classic. I recommend it to anyone who is old enough to comprehend what the book is about.	5
I was worried when I first started reading the book because my friend told me that it was slow paced. the courtship between two people was different back then than it is today so you have to be prepared for it. other than that small detail I completely loved the book. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are a great couple. I enjoyed it so much I read it again. if you are the kind of person to wonder how dating or romance happened then read this book; you will absolutely love the chemistry between the two.	5
I wished I had read this novel in high school. I have been missing out!a terrific,classic read that I recommend to all.	5
My favorite book ever! It is wonderfully written and the plot is exciting and hard to put down once started.	5
Awesome book!!!! Loved it and the movie!!!! Will be reading more of Jane Austen, don't know why I haven't read these before!!!	5
Wonderful, feel like is am being transported to another time. Love her style of writing and the way the characters come to life	5
I love this publishers collection of Jane Austen books, with all the facts, and side notes throughout the story it makes for a great read!	4
Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful work. It is actually quite hilarious at times, especially when looking at it through the lens of today. A good read for all!	5
The reading experience was pleasurable due to the contrast between black text and white page background. I would have loved to see illustrations though.	5
No matter how many times i read this book i always find more that i love about it! darcy and elizabeth are a most amazing couple, they dont make them like that any more!	5
Jane Austen is a must read for all generations. Pride and Prejudice is one of her greatest stories. A classic story to be read over and over.	5
It is one of my favourite books ever. I could read it over and over again.I also watched the movie twice, but it doesn't give you the experience the book does.	5
I have always loved Pride and Prejudice. It is a stroy I read over and over every few years. There are so many similarities to life everywhere and how pride and prejudice could get in the way of happiness if we let it. I love that I can now read it on my kindle as well!	5
Very well written British literature. Example of the life and times during this period, giving an insight of day to day living	5
There is nothing to say about "Pride and Prejudice" that most readers don't already know. It is a brilliant novel from the pen of Jane Austen, and therefore should be read be every intelligent person. I already had a copy or two of the book, as well as countless film versions, but I needed a large print edition since I'm now old. And it's nice to be able to read the book without my glasses again. So if you're in your 40s and love this book, your home library or bedside table needs this large print edition of it.	5
I love this book and read it every couple years, now I have it at my fingertips, with the kindle app.	5
I have not read a lot of this book yet. It is very interesting. It is set in older times when horses and buggies were used.	4
I've seen several movie versions of the book, and decided to read it again since the first time that I read it was in high school in 1964. I loved reading it again and to see how much the movies were condensed. Reading the book also clarified some questions that I had about the movies. It's such a wonderful story and so well written.	5
Anyone who loves Pride and Prejudice will enjoy this edition. Added some flavor to the story. I would recommend to family and friends.	5
Brilliant, as expected, well written , enjoyed very much, as good as expected from the Bbc adaptation. Will read again	5
One of my favorite books ever. I started reading this Nov. 1st and finished now. I couldn't put my Kindle down, and it died several times because I wouldn't charge it. I loved it so much.	5
I loved the book, so I was interested in seeing this illustrated version. I like to draw Victorian pictures and then pop culturize them in a sort of "Dali" way.	4
Classic book will read in one sitting, fall in love with then read all over again, to fall in love all over again.	5
I had already read two books by different authors that came after Pride and Prejudice. I loved the first two books and was not disappointed in Pride And Prejudice. It was full of intrigue and romance, could not put it down.	4
Ok, so the language can be a little rough at times, but reading this book on my kindle was easier because I can look up the definitions without losing the flow of the book. I'm on my fourth read of this book and it gets better each time. A must read classic!	5
This is such a great novel. I have the paper book, one on my kindle, and also 2 movies. I think this is the best book from Austen.	5
the reason i have to tell you i liked it was because i did not finish it just got busy and my son deleted it, but i did like what i had read so far about half way through	5
I read this in high school, and this was perfect to come back to most def. one of the greatest books I have ever read!	5
And I've read it more than once! One of my absolute favorite books ever, such a WONDERFUL story with great characters! Definately worth the read over and over again	5
There's not much new to say about Jane Austen though in my experience readers of classic novels either love her or hate her. When I was younger I found her books to be too sugary for my taste but now I find her work to be very enjoyable. Perhaps it comes with age :-). It's a great love story to read on a stormy night in front of the fire. Wonderful character development. If one prefers more angst I'd recommend something like Rememberance of Things Past :-).	5
All of Jane Austen's writings are exceptional but Pride and Prejudice has always been my favorite. It is so well written; full of such amazing, well-developed characters you either love or hate. The plot is so enjoyable and the humor is so well done it's fascinating! Everyone who loves to read should read this book.	5
With the language written for another time period I had to read it slow but I enjoyed it once I got the hand of the writing style. Now one of my favorites.	5
I read this book in high school and enjoyed is somewhat. Recently I read it again and was far more impressed. It gives a great description of the period (19th century) and Austen's character development is wonderful. There are many lines often quoted today and many miss out because they never read the book. Her humor is subtle but witty. It's doesn't have the action of many books today but it is relaxing reading.The Kindle version of the book is good. It is clear and easy to read with good navigation (for a Kindle).	4
Such a great read. The book and movie are both amazing. I would recommend for anyone to read this book. Jane Austen was an amazing writer.	5
This is a classic, a favorite among my family and peers and a story that never gets old. In a time when being proper was taught, and social standing was what you were born into somehow true love sometimes prevails. Jane Austen, although never married, can write with the soul of a true romantic. She uses wit and twists on what was considered &#34;normal&#34; in her time period and made a masterpiece that lives on through the ages.This is a love story about a girl named Elizabeth Bennet, who lives in a less than grand social stature with her sisters, her father, and her outspoken mother. She is witty, lovable and in a word headstrong. Although she does not realize it, the love of her life, Mr. Darcy is fighting with his own sense of propriety and moral guidelines to put a halt to the love he feels for this young woman.Engaging, with characters you love and in some cases cannot help but love to hate bring together a truly remarkable novel that will be hard to put down,	5
who doesn't love this book? Excellent piece of literature. I enjoyed this in high school and decided to get the ebook for an overseas flight. This is definitely one of my favorite books.	5
In all seriousness, this is a classic piece of English literature. Austen has amazing characters and a wonderful insight into the era. Every English speaker should read this book at some point in their lives.	5
This was my third or fourth reading of P&P--every; five or six years I have to go back to it to become reacquainted with Darcy, Lizzie, Lady Catherine and of course Mr. Collins and Mrs. Bennett. They all hold up beautifully: gloriously pompous, spectacularly arrogant, continually conniving and of course proud and prejudiced. There is so much to enjoy: language, wit, style and plot all converge to create, to my way of thinking, the best novel of the 19th century.Academicians all seem to prefer Emma, some folks like Sense and Sensibility more. But for me, P&P; is a cut above. Call it what you will--a comic novel, a novel of manners--there is such energy and joy in Austen's humor and wit. Never censorious, even the most pompous and disagreeable have a reason for being--not really harmful, they just move the plot along to its terrific denouement.If it has been awhile since you have read it, give it another read. Not only will you not be disappointed--I think you will be continually amazed that two hundred years later, Pride and Prejudice still works its magic.	5
The book gets 5 stars of course. But the printing of this particular version is TERRIBLE. It's apparently a "print on demand" book from Tribeca Books. Instead of using real quotation marks and apostrophes, they use inch marks and foot marks. It looks terrible. The margins are tiny and the text is packed onto every page, making the book only 253 long, hard to read pages (when properly set it should be at least 350 pages). Yes to Jane Austen, no to Tribeca Books, who basically are just ripping off a public domain book and typesetting it horribly. I had to walk into a bookstore and buy a different publisher's version of this book it was so annoying. The one I got was only $5 and much easier to read.	1
Amazon.com is amazing, so I'm not giving it one star because I hate Amazon.com because I don't. But I found Pride and Prejudice extremely boring but maybe that's just me. It was just so hard for me to read I like almost died it's so exasperatingly long and sooooooooooooooooooooo boring!!!!!	1
In trying to get books imported to my newly-purchased Kindle, this one made it to the Kindle but was not really a title I wanted.	2
I read this book and got bored with it after page 35 it was confusing overall I didn't like it	3
Overall, this novel was a good read. However, it lulled in many places and a lot of determination was required to finish this novel. I am pleased I did though, as the ending was very well written and the portrayal of characters by Austen (particularly Elizabeth and Darcy) were very captivating - but not on a level with Dickens.As I suggested to a friend, this novel is a classic, by all means read it. However, don't be in a hurry to do so and if you never get round to it, oh well!	3
I shouldn't be writing this, as I am apparently missing something in this book. Jane Austen was obviously an intelligent lady, had great facility with the language, was able to make keen observations, and had a good soul. But reading this was an exercise in grim duty. I could not have cared less about any of the characters or the outcome of the "plot." The one character with any potential of interest was Darcy, and he turned out to be a very dull boy. This seems to be the 19th century version of today's romance novel, written for a certain audience. Nothing wrong with that, I suppose, but I would rather even read Russian novels of the same century--another literary torture chamber, but a more interesting one.	2
I read the entire thing. I can't even explain why. The characters were flat. The plot was predictable. The writing didn't really stand out. I still read it all the way through, so I guess that counts for something.	3
I am sorry, I know that this book is loved by millions and I should love it; but, I do not. I just could not get into it. It is so bland that I could not even finish. Thank the stars for cliff notes.	2
Pride and Prejudice by Jane AustinPride and Prejudice by Jane Austin was first published in 1813 by T. Egerton, Whitehall, and is a classic tale of love, hate, and heartbreak. Its realistic fiction genre makes this 360 (or so) page story able to relate to today. You can imagine some of the emotions throughout and although there are no illustrations, you can use your own mind to picture the story. The tale takes us on turns and elaborates on the drama in the lives of Elizabeth Bennet, Jane Bennet, and their romances with the men in the book. Jane Austin, who is a widely recognized author today, was not recognized much during her lifetime. She was born in 1775 and unfortunately passed away 1817 because of an illness. In that time she wrote many books, one being Pride and Prejudice. Her family was compassionate of her writings and took it into their own hands to try to get them published. Only a few managed to get published, however. During the 20th century Pride and Prejudice, and many of Austin's other works, finally became recognized and were seen as great novels by many readers. They were published and became best sellers among many companies. Pride and Prejudice is one of the most read books today by adolescents and adults of many ages. Many people enjoy this roller coaster tale and it's occasionally comical characters.The characters in Pride and Prejudice have very distinct personalities, which contribute to the ups and downs of the story. However, to truly understand the customs of the four main characters in this book, you must put yourself in the beginning of 1800's, during the Napoleonic Wars (1797-1815), in the town of Hertfordshire. The setting explains the way in which the characters act. The characters personalities make for many moods; including love, hate, passion, loss, and urgency. The main character is Elizabeth Bennet and she is also the narrator of the story. She is the second eldest of the Bennet daughters and her smart, quick wit sometimes makes her perceive people too quickly. Elizabeth occasionally fails to dig deep into a person's true story and she keeps her guard up at first impressions. Jane Bennet is the eldest of the Bennet daughters and is known to be the most beautiful. She is pressured throughout the story to marry soon because of her age and her relationship with Mr. Bingley shapes the book. Mr. Charles Bingley is a young man of wealth and looks, who comes to Hertfordshire. He owns the Netherfield estate and when he meets Jane he falls in love with her. The last main character is Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. He owns the Pemberly estate and is seen throughout the story as a proud, judgmental man. Towards the end of the book these portrayals change and we find out Mr. Darcy's true character. Some other side characters include: Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, the other Bennet daughters, Mr. Darcy's sister, Mr. Bingley's sister, Mrs. De Bourgh, and Mr. Wickham. All the characters have elements that are special to their part in the book. They are all unique.The beginning of this love story starts out with the arrival of Mr. Charles Bingley, in the town of Longbourn. He moves into the Netherfield estate accompanied by his sister, Miss Caroline Bingley, and his friend, Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. The Bennets, another family of Longbourn, hear this news and they set their hopes high that Mr. Charles Bingley will marry one of their daughters. Throughout the first few chapters, we see how attached Mr. Bingley becomes to Jane, who is the eldest of the Bennet daughters, and that Mr. Darcy, too, shows a strange attitude towards Elizabeth, the second eldest of the Bennet daughters. In the middle, the conflicts arise that shape the ending of the book. The Bingley residence surprisingly moves away to London and Jane is heartbroken. Elizabeth goes to visit her friend there, that summer, and although she does not see Mr. Bingley, she does have a few interactions with Mr. Darcy. Darcy's stubborn, selfish behavior unfolds at these points and we learn that he is actually in love with Elizabeth. Elizabeth does not feel equal love towards him because of her own stubbornness and failure to look at a person's true identity. Towards the end of the book, Elizabeth realizes how blind she had been about Mr. Darcy and begins to love him back, realizing that they are actually very similar in character. Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley come back to Longbourn and Mr. Bingley confesses that he still loves Jane. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth reunite confessing their love as well. The rise and fall of the different emotions in the plot make for many exciting climaxes.Sometimes the difference between what your heart feels and what your brain thinks can make things confusing. That is what happens in Pride and Prejudice. A good theme for the book would be that you shouldn't judge a person or come to assumptions about them until you know their real story. Poor Elizabeth feels a roller coaster of emotions towards Mr. Darcy throughout the book, from love to hate, then back to love. She just doesn't understand why he acts the way he does. He's confusing to her. He acts as though he is very proud of himself in the beginning and he is not very kind to people who he doesn't know. Later he warms up to Elizabeth; however it may be a little late for him, since she has already established her feelings towards him. The turning point of the story, when we really see how the theme fits, is when Elizabeth goes to Pemberly while the thinks Mr. Darcy is away. She realizes that her feelings have changed because she knows his real story. She read Mr. Darcy's letter, which explained a lot, and she knows then why he acts the way he does. It begins to make sense to her. What Elizabeth originally thought about Mr. Darcy was all different now. She just needed to know the real him. The theme really makes for an exciting realization at the turning point of Pride and Prejudice.Have you ever been on a kiddie roller coaster, that had its ups and downs but those hills were really not exciting? That's how I felt about this book. It was slow moving at times and it never had an enormous climax. Rather, it had a few small ones, which were very predictable. While reading the book, I discovered that I felt as though Pride and Prejudice had a little too much description and narration, instead of dialogue. The lack of dialogue made it difficult to truly feel the characters emotions. I had a hard time putting myself in the characters shoes. The love story was not portrayed as very romantic because the characters never really connected on that level. Overall, I did not care for the book Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin.	3
Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin, who was born on December 16, 1775, is a classic novel that is loved by many because of its heroine, Elizabeth Bennet. The book was published in 1813, but Miss Austin actually intended it to be published in 1797, but sadly, it was rejected. Jane Austin has also published Sense and Sensibility, a story about two sisters with a meager amount of money, Mansfield Park, and many others. Although Miss Austin produced many great works, she had to leave the world sometime. She died in 1817 by a sudden illness. Even though Jane Austin died many years ago, her books are regarded as some of the best books ever written.In a town called Longbourn, sometime in the 19th century, Miss Elizabeth Bennet lives with her family, Mrs. Bennet, a foolish woman who only cares if her daughters marry, Mr. Bennet, a sensible man who runs the house, but is in an unhappy marriage, Mary, Caroline, Lydia, a snooty girl who only cares about herself, and her favorite sister, Jane, who is madly in love with Mr. Charles Bingley, a wealthy man who purchases Netherfield, his estate that is close to the Bennet's house. Elizabeth is a sensible young lady in her mid-twenties, but sometimes let her pride makes her think in prejudice ways because she likes to ponder on the character of others. Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy is one such person that Elizabeth believes has a bad character, although she doesn't know him very well. With so many characters about, sometimes it's hard to remember who is who, but after a while you get quite used to it.The main conflict in Pride and Prejudice is the feelings that Elizabeth has for Mr. Darcy. In the beginning of the story, she utterly hates him, but near the middle, she starts doubting her way she views character. Because of the interchanging turmoil in Elizabeth's heart, she isn't sure what to feel about Mr. Darcy. Another conflict is Mr. Bingley's feelings for Jane, who isn't even sure of his feelings for her. The plot pretty much centers around those two main conflicts. Although, there are many other mini conflicts that the plot focuses on also. One example would be Mr. Collin's conflict with Elizabeth. He wishes her to marry him, because he is supposed to take over the estate when Mr. Bennet dies. Mr. Bennet, a cautious and humorous man, is not so happy that his cousin is going to take over the estate. Even though this is how I perceived the book, I'm sure it's very close to what the critics say.When Mr. Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, the whole book starts getting more thought provoking. Will Elizabeth say yes? Or will she say no? Either way, there is more than just her answer. Why did she say what she said? Well, I guess you'll have to read to find out. While you are wrapping that around your head, let me tell you about the theme of the story. There are several themes in Pride and Prejudice but a main one is reputation. Reputation really matters in this book. Mrs. Bennet, with her obnoxious manners and comments, disgraced the family several times throughout the story. And when a certain someone runs away, the family is in danger of being condemned forever in disgrace. And while the Elizabeth endured all of this, the family hardly noted that any of this was occurring, maybe because they only care about getting their daughters married, since that would bring them money. Either way, reputation really matters in this book.All in all, I really didn't like this book because it was really boring. I know the book is a classic, but it made me go to sleep. The book is written beautifully, don't get me wrong. But it didn't keep my attention very well. Yes, I did finish it, and let's just say I could see the finish a mile away. While the beginning was slightly compelling, it just wasn't something I was willing to read. I had to forcefully work my way through this book. Elizabeth, who was an interesting person, made too many prejudices that it got on my nerve after a while. I will say though, that maybe if I tried harder, I could've eased into this book much better if I wasn't rushing to read it. On my scale of buy, borrow, or skip, I would say borrow, but only if you are really into classics.	3
It took my third try to finally get through Pride and Prejudice. I'll start with the good: the writing is fantastic. I can't argue with that...I love the language. You can pretty much diss someone or compliment someone in so many different ways that I wish our language wasn't so abbreviated. In a few years we'll all be talking in acronyms at the rate we're going, but anyway, back to the story. I understand that women during that time really didn't have a place in society except to stay home and make babies...but what I couldn't stand from the book was that it was a bunch of people sitting around just talking or singing around a piano. It's a love story between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett, but I really couldn't see the love. It was more infatuation or a little crush so the fact that they "SPOILER ALERT" got together in the end seemed so forced. I didn't even like Elizabeth because she had this holier than thou sort of attitude, but I guess that's just her pride and prejudice. I guess a book about a bunch of women trying to find husbands doesn't interest me.	3
One can easily be mistaken by pride and prejudice, which can later lead to foolish misunderstanding. Throughout this novel the reader can observe how a marriage can secure social status and economic security. Mrs. Bennet would do anything to guarantee both for her daughters. Pride and Prejudice is a story of love, drama and life at England during the 19-century. The author of this classic of literature is Jane Austen. Jane Austen is the seventh daughter of eight children. Being daughter of Rev. George Austen and Cassandra, Austen was born in December 16th, 1775 at Steventon, Hampshire, England. Austen died on 18 of July 1817 at the age of 41 in Winchester, Hampshire, England. Jane died unmarried as well as her sister Cassandra Elizabeth who was 2 years older than Jane. Jane wrote several books before her death including Pride and Prejudice who's initial title would be First Impressions.The arrival of Mr. Charles Bingley to Nederfield Park, caused quite a scandal. Mr. Bingley was a young single man with a huge fortune, and the perfect candidate for husband for one of Mrs. Bennet's daughters. Mr. Bingley's sister and closest friend, Miss Bingley and Mr. Darcy had arrived with him. Mr. Bennet paid unwillingly a visit to Mr. Bingley under order of her wife with the purpose of causing a good impression. Mr. Bingley encountered the Bennet's at a ball and was allured by the oldest Miss Bennet, Jane. Not only once did Mr. Bingley ask her to a dance with him, but twice. Miss Bingley became an acquaintance of Jane and became very fond of her.Throughout the novel we are able to observe how society was back in the 19th century. A woman's priority was to get a wealthy and high ranking husband who would be able to provide a good social status to her and their children. The fact that Mr. Collins would inherit the Bennet's property after Mr. Bennet passed away allows us to see further into women's rights. Women were not oppressed as they used to be but they still didn't had the same amount of privileges we do in the present. Mr. Bennet could not leave their daughters any inheritance because they were all women and the property was entailed, meaning that only males could inherit it. The book is so well written with so much detail that it turns one from an outsider into an insider.One is able to observe what a typical day would be in the old days, especially for women, how would they travel and how long their visits would last. I found it quite peculiar how in the past people used to be guests for months and in the present it is less likely, one usually is more busy and just stops for a while and moves on. In the novel Elizabeth spends four weeks at Hunsford with Mrs. Collins and she is still begged by Lady Catherine to remain. Jane also spends around three months in London in her aunt's residence. We can see and advance in the way Mr. Darcy thinks. Many would have believed that Elizabeth's imprudence would be considered of bad taste and rude, but Mr. Darcy admired her for all the reasons someone else may dislike her. Elizabeth didn't accepted Mr. Collins proposal and she still declined Mr. Darcy's proposal not afraid of remaining unmarried. In contrast Miss Lydia Bennet was so desperate in getting a husband. On her way home Lidya commented to her sisters the following,"Let us hear what has happened to you all since went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should of not married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Philips wants you to get husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy should had better have taken Mr. Collins;but I do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord! How I should like to be married before any of you! And then I would chaperon you about to all the balls."I found this book intriguing since it shows how us humans may be blinded by prejudices and pride. Sometimes we may judge too fast or too harshly and that no matter how bad something seems it may not be the absolutely true. Elizabeth judged Mr. Darcy too quickly, being blinded by prejudice, she believed completely what Mr. Wickham had said and didn't confirm it with Mr. Darcy. Mr. Darcy was sometimes too proud that he acted foolishly, he didn't show any signs of his feelings towards Elizabeth till the last minute, he didn't tell the absolute truth about Mr. Wickham in order to avoid judging and to conserve his pride. Even though Jane Austen is not here to see the impact her stories has had, this piece of art specifically will always be remembered as one of the classics of literature.	5
Okay, just to set this straight, I absolutely love Jane Austen and always have. Pride and Prejudice is by far my favourite novel and I love the movies too, but this kindle edition was killing me.What's with the caps lock where italics should be? I imagined everytime there was a caps Elizabeth would be screaming. It was just irritating.Also, there were a few errors here and there.I recommend buying the paperback or hardcover version of Pride and Prejudice if you really get annoyed by errors like I do, but overall it's still for free, and let's face it, Mr. Darcy in print is good no matter what.	4
It was different reading this book which I must have read nearly 30 times..this is my first experience reading it via my kindle. I must say it is different I think I still prefer the book. However saying that ereader/kindles are great for travel and reading on trains etc. I may yet become a fan..	4
I don't know why my high school didn't have us read this novel - it's a lovely book, and I found it easy to read and follow along. It's easy to see why this book has inspired so many other authors to draw from it and adapt the story to give it new spins... it's almost an archetypal "boy meets girl" story, including the wrinkles at the beginning that make them think they are all wrong for each other, when it's all just a matter of perception.Highly recommended, to anyone that reads!	5
Really enjoyed reading this book and would encourage others to read it. The classic books are part of history so please share this book and other classic books with family and friends.	4
Like all the other Jane Austen books I loved this one just as much. Jane Austen is famous for her characterisation and this book proves it to you even more. Trust me - you won't be able to get your hands off this classic that is still entertaining to read today. A book that shows us how two minds can eventually meet and harbour friendship and love. YOU WON'T REGRET IT.	5
This is a classic novle , I have watched its film and also been impressed by the love story. Not only the languages but also the plot is vivid and glorious.	4
Romantic. I started wishing i had lived during that time. This book started my fascination with the classics. Now, i cant stop reading them.	4
My husband purchased my Kindle for me for Christmas. I was a little skeptical; I love holding my books. My son showed me how to purchase books on Amazon for my Kindle and off I went. There is no turning back now; LOVE MY KINDLE and LOVE that I purchased Pride and Prejudice for it! The writer, Jane Austin really knows her stuff and knows how to capture a reader! I would reccomend this book highly!!	5
This is considered the Jane Austen masterpiece and is one of the most popular books of English literature and I can see why. Jane Austen paints a gorgeous picture of what life for a woman in 19th century England was like. Her characters are beautifully developed and the main character Elizabeth is how I would hope I would be if I lived in that era. Smart, a freethinker and not afraid to show little gumption.This is one book that I will read again and again throughout my lifetime. I can't recommend it enough.	5
I can understand why this is considered a classic of literature. I saw the movie first and then just read it. The story is more for women, I think, but I confess I got into the drama once Darcy and Elizabeth started interacting. I could have done without some (or all) of the sisters, but I guess they were an essential part of the novel to show what silly girls were like in those days.	4
I am new to kindle books and found this book for free. Boy, make sure you go in and READ about the book before you even download it. I can read a book in a day this book took me over a week to read. I COULD NOT stay with this book. I made myself finish it but was driving myself nuts doing so. I didn't even want to give this book one start. I am so glad I did not have to purchase this I would of wanted my money back.	1
They just don't make stories like this anymore! So well written for the era into this day. Available on Kindle!	5
I adore this cover- its beautiful and reminds me of true love. Another special twilight cover to add to my Bella Swan collection	5
Love the book -1st time I have ever read this.Suggestion: read it quickly. If you read slowly you will not gather the concepts since it is so wordy	5
One of the most beloved novels and a necessary component for any library. Print and format is fine for a free domain book.	5
What can you say, it's Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. I love this story and am very happy to have it on my phone. I've already read it once. Download was easy.	5
I've always loved this book, from the moment I had to read in high school, and every subsequent reading thereafter. It's the greatest romance ever written, in my humble opinion. Austen is an excellent writer, sprinkling her work with surprisingly profound assertions, and witty one-liners alike. I would recommend to anyone.	5
a book everyone should read if they havent. A love story anyone would enjoy. Plus Jane Austen wrote it enough said	5
This is in my opinion the best book ever written. Having read the other excellent reviews here there is really nothing i can add except to say that i love Jane Austen and everything she wrote, and that Pride and prejudice is my favourite book of all time. I am an avid reader and i enjoy most genres, but Pride and Prejudice is the only novel i have read again and again over the years. Brilliant!	5
one of the best books ever written! These topics are eternal and Jane Austen displays it with such charm you can't stop reading until you finish the book.	5
As a classic, it can be read and then reread, finding new ways to apply its' story to ones own life	5
I love this audio version of Pride and Prejudice but the Cd's would not play. I went ahead and purchased the MP3 formatted cd and now listen to it on our mp3 player. Waste of time and money for the cd's.	1
In high school, my enjoyment of old European art was always hampered by my gratitude that I'm not any of these exasperating people or in any of their stifling situations. I felt so blessed and superior that I escaped sitting around mending bonnets all day, waiting to go on a walk- how boring and pathetic! Upon rereading this years later, I was able to let go of these old prejudices and more objectively view the characters in the situation they were in. That was when I realized Austen is a genius: I saw how much she understands and subtly, humorously conveys, and how little I'd understood before. Now I actually consider this to be a work of rationalist literature, in addition to a brilliant romantic comedy.In my previous reading, I thought that the only intelligent, reasonable character was Mr. Darcy, and that everyone else's problems was brought on by their own idiocy, of which their unjust hatred of the virtuous, blameless Mr. Darcy was only further evidence. This time around, I realized that he caused some of these problems himself. Mr. Darcy's arrogance caused problems he could've easily avoided by being slightly nicer. Instead, he prided himself in his bluntness and in his own virtuousness, thus causing people to resent him, because who likes someone who thinks he's better than you, even if he actually is? Similarly, Lizzy demonstrates all of our tendencies to like and be less questioning of information coming from someone who flatters us. This causes us to have errors in judgment and believe things we would otherwise be more critical of. Mr. Darcy shows an amazing ability to step outside personal biases and view things from other's perspectives- a rationalist romantic hero! Austen understood the female wish: a rich, moral, loyal man completely rational about all things, except for his irrational love for his weird woman.	5
Truly one of the best stories of all time. Pride and Prejudice will always be a classic. Bravo Jane Austen.	5
If you like romantic classics you do not need my advice...if not do not read this book! I enjoyed it very much!	4
Great book for women or anyone who loves to gossip! Also contains great words and gives you a good idea of marriage and romance customs in the past.	4
Tough read, but it's a classic. Half way through and it's hard to put down. I recently read Jane Eyre, so I didn't have to look up as many words : )	4
Never tire of reading the &#34; oldies&#34; but &#34; goodies&#34; The tried and true literature of the past always brings pleasure to the reader.	4
Well, I will be honest and say from the beginning that I did not enjoy 'Pride and Prejudice'. I did not find the plot particularly interesting, nor the characters particularly engaging. Then why give it four stars?Because, dear readers, it is perfectly possible to not enjoy something and still hold a great deal of respect for it, and there are very few reviews that acknowledge this fact. Personally, I have never been particularly interested in domestic drama of the 19th century, but this is an important work, and should be read on that merit at least. Many readers seem to forget that at the time of writing, women did only have the choice to marry, and for an upper-class young lady, marrying a rich man was her only option. After all, she could not work, because there was a universal horror of being "in trade" (witness Mr. Darcy's extreme rudeness to Elizabeth having relatives who actually worked). Mrs. Bennett, shallow and stupid though she was, did have a legitimate reason to be worried, since the extremely sexist inheritance laws meant that she and her daughters were to be turned out of their home and onto the charity of relatives the moment her husband died. Small wonder that marrying each of them off was her only concern.Even if one can not enjoy the book, modern women can still look back with a thrill of horror over this idea of being birds in gilded cages - being essentially the property of their fathers and husbands, with nothing to do but stack up "accomplishments" (see Mary Bennett). Jane Austen recognized the whole thing as the barely disguised slave market it was and wrote biting criticisms, smuggled into stories about romance and marriage. And that is why, though I do not enjoy her subject matter or her writing style in particular, I hold the greatest regard for her as a writer and would recommend the book on technical merit and historical interest in the very least.	4
What a wonderful book! This book was even better the 2nd time and now that I have brushed up on my P&P, I will hopefully be reading Mr. Darcy's Obsession next month. I love the book, "pride and prejudice" it's a wonderful story about a family in the 1700's and the classes of society. Reminds us how different things were. Has a Dramatic story with a beautiful classic love story intertwined. If I was to chose a modern day version of this book it would be Bridget Jones Diary, because she is in love with the man who is not who he seems to be, despises another man who she sees so wrong. Ends up falling in love with the man she thought of as a horrible man. What a great read. I also love my new book light! Target 9.99 was the best investment ever. I was surprised I was able to finish this book while we had company here, but with a few sleepless nights I breezed right through this book. I give this book 5 stars	5
I have to start off by saying that the book description here is awful. Will sister Jane marry Mr. Bingley? Will the arrogant Lady Catherine de Burgh's intrigues be foiled? WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO SISTER LYDIA?Who cares?!Unfortunately, that's actually not that unfair a representation of the book's contents. I read it well over a decade ago, maybe just out of high school, and that would about sum up what I thought of it then. I thought I should give it another chance, though---and to be fair, there is a bit more substance (and style!) to the novel than that. It did take me a while to get into, though---it is rather dry for stretches, and nearly every character is not just unsympathetic, but almost intolerable. But by the end, I was very interested in the fate of Elizabeth, who was the only almost wholly likable character.Thematically, I have mixed feelings...on the one hand, it's nice that Elizabeth wants to marry out of affection, and not just for reasons of family, connections, wealth, etc. This comes out especially in her conversation with Lady de Burgh toward the end when the latter comes to exact her promise not to marry Mr. Darcy (which was the best part of the book). However, you still have to kind of wonder whether Elizabeth would have fallen in love with Mr. Darcy and wanted to marry him if he weren't quite so wealthy...when one of her sisters asks her when she started falling in love with him, she replies, "When I first saw the grounds at Pemberley!" (Mr. Darcy's estate), or something to that effect. She is joking, of course...but maybe not entirely.Also, I found it depressing how almost every other female character in the book made connections based primarily on those reasons of connections and such, or worse...Elizabeth's friend Charlotte accepts the proposal of a man she clearly doesn't love (just two days after he had proposed to Elizabeth) and who is utterly obnoxious, just to gain a bit of security; her sister Lydia is basically forced at the age of fifteen to marry the biggest scoundrel in the book, whose own consent to marry the girl is bought off him for an exorbitant blackmail bribe by Mr. Darcy (who does this for love of Elizabeth---how is this supposed to be a romantic gesture again, exactly?). Of course, I realize Austen did these things as foils to contrast with Elizabeth's own case, but to me it was still rather unpleasant and somewhat undercut the romance of the story.But the main storyline involving Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy is nice, and there is a lot of genuinely amusing wit in Austen's writing (particularly in the character of Mr. Bennett, who you have to wonder why he married the incredibly annoying Mrs. Bennett in the first place---Austen pretty much just chalks it up to a youthful mistake on his part). On the whole, worth reading once, or maybe twice if you were too young to appreciate it the first time around, but I doubt I'll be revisiting it again...at least not for another couple of decades!Three and a half stars.	4
I doubt I'm saying anything here that someone somewhere hasn't already said... but, here it goes! In my own opinion...Perhaps one of the best books ever written, Austen takes us into 19th century rural England, where a woman's primary duty was to marry and marry well, since inheritance was out of the question. This novel tells the classic story of the rich, eligible bachelor, Fitzwilliam Darcy, who could have anyone he wanted, and young, but outspoken and bold Elizabeth Bennet, the second eldest of five girls who's family lives fairly well but ranks rather low on the social class spectrum. Hence, it's expected that she would marry should she be offered a reasonable and comfortable home, regardless of how she feels.Elizabeth Bennet may be one of literature's best heroines. Her complex and genuine character, her honesty and courage to remain true to herself regardless of the situation, makes her a lovable heroine, and one that can be related to regardless of time period. And let's admit, she is just downright witty. Darcy, while mistakenly perceived as proud and arrogant, turns out to be one the most gentlemanly and courteous men, a kind soul and romantic heart once he lets down his guard and exposes his true self. His qualities are ones women still crave to find in men today.The characters, realistic and well-rounded, the accurate portrayal of 19th century British social life and setting, and Austen's superb writing creates a masterpiece full of romance, pride, social status, family values, and prejudice. This timeless romantic tale is one of the best love stories of all time, a true classic! I absolutely adored this book!	5
It's amazing how much drama Jane Austen can inject into what is little more than a prolonged courtship, but she does and she does it with humor and brilliant writing and a charming but insightful style.	5
"Pride & Prejudice" is without doubt a masterpiece of English literature. This funny, engaging and extraordinarily well-written work of classic fiction not only entertains and enchants, but also gives a glimpse into a very different time, that on closer inspection isn't very foreign at all. If you have not read this book (or if you only remember it from being compelled to read it in school) I cannot more heartily recommend picking up this free ebook and giving Austen a chance!	5
it is a light, simple, kind of fun story line, but strongly pointed out the bitterness of two people being not fitting in the socity back then, and the sweetness of their love. most of all the bitter-sweetness of hoping Jane Austen herself could be in the happy ending of this story forever.	5
I have read this book in the hard cover many times and watched the series many times as well. Reading on my new kindly was simply a delicious experience again. I can almost quote dialogue but still am totally absorbed by the plot/s each time. The selection of language used throughout the book is superb and sometimes makes me think I wish we still spoke that way. Shame so much swearing and slang has entered our english language, that maybe high school students should read it to learn a new selection of words, or to have it reinforced that there are thousands of delicious words out there that far create more meaning than slang! A classic and always will be.	5
This book is one of my most charished possessions and has been for a good many years. I read it atleast once a year if not more. And Mr. Darcy is the man of dreams. The only thing truly missing is the happy ending the author herself never got.	5
This was a reread of a book I had read many years ago...A reminder that we are losing our grasp of the english language. She has a rare talent that I have never found with another writer..	5
This novel is one of my favorites i ever read. Romanticism is in the air when you read this, i recommend with all my heart.	5
How can you argue with a classic? This is my favorite of all Jane Austen's books; I think I've seen just about every film adaptation of it ever made. To have it in a kindle format is nice for a change, though the formatting is a little...odd. I think I prefer the paper format.	5
This edition is the best version for high school students to use. Presented in a style easy for school students and still true to the original.	4
A great story of intricacies of interpersonal relationships in love, family, and courtship. This book really shows the way of life in the earlier centuries. There is everything that makes it a good exciting story and flows in such a way that it always keeps your interest.	5
I have to read this book several times a year. I love how Elizabeth and Darcy have sparring matches and how their love stands the test of time. I give it five stars.	5
Starts off very slow, but comes into its own near the last 100 pages. Great read. I'll definitely be looking into more Jane Austen books.	4
Freaking awesome, but a little less romantic than I expected. It tends to focus on other people's affairs just as mush as the main characters, and at one point I skipped through some of that extra jazz. It makes for a good read though, and gives really good insight to how society was way beck when.	4
While I haven't read this version yet I seen it for the kindle and knew I had to have it.I love the book, I love the movie (BBC version with Colin Firth), and I love Jane AustinI have to admit that I watched the movie first having avoided the the book for years. I thought it would be to dry and boring. Having seen the movie I had to find out what was left out, so I took the leap.I loved it! I do think that having watched the movie helped. It was pretty well true to the book a few things left out. I did find some parts a bit dry and the speech awkward and don't think if I were younger would have had the patience to move thru it. It is good and definitely worth the push.	5
My favorite book. Being able to re read this on a stormy day or on a sunny beach any time I want to on my kindle is the bomb.	5
They sent me the wrong book but they were quick to contact me and offer to refund my money AND told me not to worry about sending the book back so that I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle. Wrong item, Good service.	4
It's the fourth time I read it and it gets better every time. The literature is just ideal. I love it!	5
I haven't completed this book but from what Ive read so far I feel I will get great satisfaction from reading.	3
I got what I paid for. I paid zero and I got a story written about 200 years ago. Pride and Prejudice is about a poor girl and a rich english noble. Not much of a plot, Will the girl become a princess? I do read love stories but they should have a interesting story plot.lee sullivan	2
I am very happy with this seller. The book arrived quickly as well as the condition it was described as.	5
I READ the book some time ago and then saw the movie and wanted to refresh. My memory. It was just as good as I REMEMBERED.	4
Pride and Prejudice is an awesome book. You can not help but fall in love with Mr. Darcy and admire Elizabeth, she is a strong and smart woman, he is sexy and handsome. It is obvious they are meant to be together and the fact the it is him that realizes he is in love with her sooner than she does, it makes it even better. :-)	5
I like the free books. Whats not to like. I would have never considered even reading the book so putting it in the line up was a good idea.	5
I gave this book a four out of five as it is an absolute classic, I have read this book a few times now. great book	4
great on kindle (=i'm so glad I got this when it was free. i Love Elizabeth and Mr Darcy.	5
P and P is one of my favorite stories and the first novel I reread on my new Kindle paperwhite. I loved them both	5
I've always liked Jane Austen, and this is one of her best, I feel. The ending isn't my favorite, but it's not as if I can change it. I would recommend Pride and Prejudice to all lovers of love stories.	5
This is a classic that I have read several times. Each time I return to it I find new levels of inspiration. I recommend it to anyone who loves period pieces of worth.	5
It is an interesting novel written 200 years ago but still in vogue.I don't know anybody else I could recommend it.	4
I just purchased this because it was free and I had already read it a long time ago. If you like the classics, this is a good buy.	3
I must say I never imagined I would enjoy reading a 19th century romance, but it turns out that 'Pride and Prejudice' is an easy, pleasant and surprisingly engaging read. The story is set in rural England of early 19th century and is centered around Elizabeth, second daughter of the Bennets, and her evolving relationship with 'proud' Mr Darcy. The author has done an excellent job keeping the pace of the story, while painting excellent character portraits.--A minor note:Some people observe that the name of the county where the military regiment is settled appears as "----shire" throughout the book. Strange as that may seem, it is not a typographical error; it is actually how it appears in the original (you can check the free online editions of the novel on Project Gutenberg or Google Books). According to an annotated version by David M. Shapard, that was done in purpose by the author to avoid naming a particular county, although the reason is not known for certain.	5
outstanding prodcut free...can't beat that can you?? haven't finished to book but so far it's outstandinghope you enjoy it as much as i am.....what's up??	5
I absolutely love this book!I rate this book as follows:Love interest: 5Subcharacters: 5Writing: 5Romantic Plot: 5Overall: 5	5
Love this book and have read it many times and will read it again.Ifirst read Pride and Predjest in the 40st when I was in High School. All High school students should read this book. Helen West	5
I REALLY ENJOYED THE BOOK VERY MUCH. IT WAS MY FIRST READING OF A JANE AUSTIN BOOK.I FOUND SOME OF THE READING A BIT DIFFICULT,I AM NOT USED TO THE LANGUAGE OF THAT TIME PERIOD.I WILL BUY MORE OF MS. AUSTINS BOOKS.	5
Happy with this reading material especially as I now have Kindle and can download it immediately. I can now takemy reading matter easily without having bulky books to transport.	5
I have always loved Emily Bronte & Charlotte Bronte, but had never before ventured to read any novel by Jane Austin. I must say that I was very pleasantly surprised! This book reminded me very much of some of my favorite classic novels. Two thumbs WAY up!!!	5
What can I say about this book that hasn't been said before? The story is so well written that it's timeless, one of those few that I will keep and read over and over again. Elizabeth Bennet is smart and sassy, Jane is good and even angelic, Mr Darcy is dashing and brooding. The cast is full of well developed characters who you can't help but embrace. The Bennets, a glass of wine, and a comfy chair. Bliss.	5
I read the bad review which were generally about the errors in this version. Any errors aside, this book is incredible, one of my favorite books of all time. Readers will fall in love with Elizabeth Bennet, a young girl with a big personality and an insufferable family who learns that love can mean learning to accept the person you choose, flaws and all. If you are a fan of subtle romance novels that are well written and hold messages about the nature of mankind, then Pride and Prejudice is the novel for you.	5
Amazon.com has so many varieties to choose from. You can purchase just the book, or books with information on Jane Austen's life.	5
Fun book to read employing an exciting play on words. I love the intelligent embedded satire relating to personal relationships among the characters in the book. Highly recommended.	4
It might be a classic, and &#34;old&#34; book, but really interesting to learn about past times and a very particular society.beautifully narrated by Jane Austin, in my opinion on of her best books. If you have never read a Jane Austin book this would be a good first book to introduce yourself in her world.	4
Good read. I enjoyed it much more starting about page 100. Book club book success. Glad I was some what m made to read it. Not one I would have picked up on my own.	4
A bit like a modern soap opera with all the love twists and drama, yet it moves at a steady pace.	5
What more can I really say about this book? It is a classic and is an excellent read! Although I like hardcopies better than kindle books, this has been perfect while I have been abroad.	5
Loved this book,also the characters.a few of them worked my nerves,but I still love how well written they are.Elizabeth is my favorite because she is headstrong,independent and outspokenWith so many intricate lives and plot lines interwoven,it kept me completely engrossed and it made wanting to know the fate of each character!!I loved her Austin's writing style,this book not only observes the social hierarchy of the times in which it was written,but also human natures and personalities that are eternal.I recommend this book for everyone of every time and place.	5
These are not my type of books. But I loved it anyway! The whole concept of 'I hate you so much' turned 'I love you so much(even though I don't want to)', is my favorite. I can't get enough of their bickering and denial of their feelings and everything. I may not usually read this sort of thing or pay attention to the author, but I love this particular story!	5
Always 5 stars....it really is such an epic story you can't help but love it. I want to reread it right now!!	5
I thoroughly enjoyed this book from beginning to the end! The poetic use of language to convey the thoughts of the main characters were so aptly rendered to stir a feeling of presence in that era! Well written and highly recommended!	5
Was not disappointed in the service or shipping or the product. Very satisfied with the purchase that I made. Thanks	5
Well I'll tell you that at first I could not understand what they were saying but I got the hang of it. This is my new favorite book. I Love Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett, or shall I say Elizabeth Darcy. I recommend this to people who like a good romance blindness and you got to be able to understand the language in which the book is written in. Then after or before you should watch the movie or/and the short tv show of pride and prejudice.	5
I love the classic British romances, but this one most of all. The language is dated and a dictionary is needed to understand fully Miss Austen 's meanings. Many other authors fail to fully satisfy the way this does. Every young woman dreams of her own Mr. Darcy.	5
IT took Elizabeth to the end of the book to realize that she was in love with one she had perceived to be different. Love does that to you.	4
A classic for a reason.One has to concentrate on the verse. Adjusting to the style of so many words takes getting use to. I loved the characters and story.	5
This is the great and very interesting book to read.So for your great experience, pls. try it as soon. :-)	4
Jolly good read - deservedly one of the most famous novels ever - can't believe it is now 200 years old - although the word pride does not carry the same opprobrium today as it did then and prejudice is probably a greater evil today as it was then- probably worth thinking if it as Arrogance and antipathy	4
pride an prejudice was by far the BEST book of read this year. It's absolutely amazing!!!!!!!!I recommend EVERYONE to read it,especially if you're into romance	5
I absolutely loved this old classic. If you haven't read it yet, you should, after I got used to the older English way of speaking it just flowed beautifully. A must read!	5
Placed in my file by error. Did not purchase this book. However, a great book of encouragement available at Amazon.com is Footsteps of Recovery.	5
This book was on the reading list for school. Great book and my son enjoyed reading it. I ended up ordering three more books because the whole family read the book and talked about it. I loved that I was able to get it at a great price and like always received my items in great time.	4
Jane Austen has yet to let me down. I was introduced to her with Northanger Abbey and was pleasantly surprised with the humor; this book had humor of the same type but it was refreshing to see it coming from a female protagonist. Two thumbs up (and more if I had them!)	5
This book is a must read for all those who truly love the English language. The story holds the same messages now as it did 200 years ago.	4
Love it! A must read. Human character shown at its best and worst. I can't wait to read more Austen!	5
A classic! Something everyone should take the time to read! i have reread it many times and still enjoy it just as much.	5
Of course this was an excellent read and I am excited to begin Sense and Sensibility!!! Glad I was able to get it free on my Kindle!	5
This is probably the most well known of all Jane Austen's work and I'd never read it before my class assigned it. I'm so happy to now own it on my ipod!	4
I love this book, I took a class in Jane Austen and I will read this over and over again.	5
This book has been one of my go-to happy books for a long time. It doesn't matter what's going in my life, Pride and Prejudice is always a fun, readable, delightful time.	5
This is my very favourite book of all time and I shall most likely read it again and again until I know it by heart. I recommend it to anyone and everyone in hopes that they should have the pleasure of being affected by it as I have.	5
I have wanted to read the book since I like the film version so much, the book always gives you more insight into the characters	4
i first read this book for a class in HS . A couple of years later now in college my interest for this book grew and i just knew i had to read it again, I just simply loved it. I	4
Romantic, I love the story & one of the few books I've read. I look forward to reading more classic novels that I've only ever experienced on television or on the silver screen.	5
Book was in very good condition. I absolutely love Pride and prejudice. If you have not read it. Please do.If you like this try some of Georgette Heyer books.	5
This book is still relevant in the world of today. The characters remind me of people I know. I liked it.	4
One of my favorite Jane Austen books. I have read it over and over again. I actually read it while watching the story on t.v. The book was soooo much better.	5
Five stars for this book, it's like a delicious treat to savour. Each page is like a bite of moist cake. Good for anyone who enjoys a well crafted, flowing sentence.	5
I only regret Jane Austen did not write more books than she did. So fun and true! I read it many times.	5
I loved this classic! A little long but well worth it. Something I will read again and again. Wonderful book.	4
Absolutely incredible. This creative love story shows the trials and triumphs or a man and a woman destined to be together.	5
Forget the rest of her novels. Due to Austen's limited society the themes remain startingly similiar and the characters repeat. Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy however, deserve your undivided attention.	5
i enjoyed this download also and the item was exactly as advertised... i will be downloading more stuff to read in the future.	5
This is a classic I never read before, but the Kindle price was certainly right. I enjoyed it, but as much for the history of English law regarding estates as for character development and plot. I was struck by the similarities between Pride and Prejudice and PBS' series Downton Abbey--same issues regarding inheritance of a major estate when all the children are daughters, the role of a male relative, the ambiguous relationship between the male and female protagonists, etc.	3
I was in love with the movie and I am now equally in love with this book. I enjoy the style of writing, and how easy it is to understand. What a wonderful story of strong women who are able to rise above their class. Yet, they do it through love and never sell themselves into it.	5
The book was recently read by my mother who recommended it.I loved the movie and knew I would enjoy reading. I was not disappointed.Her characters were easy for me to visualize. It kept my attention and can see why it is a classic.	5
Pride and prejudice is a romantic story that shows how two people fall in love through pride as as well as prejudice.	4
Pride and Prejudice is one of the classic greats. You cannot help but fall in love with the characters. This novel has humor and romance . . . it's a must read.	5
I have always loved this book. I would love to step back into Jane Austen world and see the families, balls, parties, and courting. It is hard to understand the language at first but if you keep going and get into a rhythm it really is a beautiful thing.	5
My first read on Kindle and I have to say it was a delight to venture back into the pages of a novel I first read many years ago.	3
Excellent book, I highly recommend it. I will read it again.Elizabeth character is most inspiring to have an open mind.	5
The language is at times hard to follow, but the book is wonderful! Beautiful classic love story with a great ending.	4
Do not waste your money on this! I thought i would get a book that looks like the original 1813 edition (ie., a scanned version of an original 1813 edition) but it looks like someone just typed the original version into word. There is absolutely no difference between this edition and the free version or any other version of Pride and Prejudice.	1
Writing styles such as Jane Austin don't usually keep my attention well and, at first, this book was no different. I had to force myself to read the first 6-7 chapters. By a quarter though the book, I found myself enjoying the writing and storyline much more. It was an enjoyable read and I liked the book very much, but I can't say I agree with others who say it's one of the greatest novels ever written. Then again, it's just not my preferred writing style. Also, I got this on my Kindle for free and the formatting was just fine.	4
Great read! I wish we still spoke in such eloquent terms. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great classic. Enjoy.	5
It was easy to download and read. I like having both physical and electronic copies if I can. It was convenient to read because of accessibility on my phone or tablet. Anywhere I got stuck waiting I could start up the book again. Of course the story is a classic too, read it because its my now fianc&eacute;e's favorite and I was brushing up for ideas before my own proposal!	5
This book gets better with time. I love sinking into the old world customs and imagine myself without phone and just pen and paper for communication.	5
A great read and one that I can read over & over again. I never tire of the classic books.	5
This is my go to book for those times when you just need a break from the real world. I am constantly reading it, once I finish it I start it over again. Jane Austen novels are indeed timeless and must be enjoyed through all generations.	5
I appreciated the character development. Differences of class and upbringing, coupled with societal exposure and expectation lead the plot through many twists and turns that keep you reading.	5
The book was written more than 50 years ago, but can still be like today. Pride can get in the way of almost anything, and so can being prejudice. The modern spin is called Prom and Prejudice. The people changed to fit the time, but not the message. It is a wonderful book worth reading.	5
I love this book, and it's really my favorite story of all time. Mr. Darcy is just about as dreamy as they come. I've read this book at least 6 times since I was 10, and that's not including all the film adaptations and mangas I watched and read on this. It's well worth the read. The Notebook has nothing on this!	5
This classic is a great love story for the ages. A must read for everyone interested in literature. Will be read over and over again.	5
Excellent character study. I find new nuances and information about the players each time I read it. I give it a 5 star rating.	5
Such a great love story! I love this book. It's absolutely one of my favorites. Great book to read in your spare time.	5
good read works on my tablet and ereader and on my notebook. good read works on my tablet and ereader and on my notebook.	5
It shipped on time and the product as advertised. Thank you very much for your prompt attention to my order.	5
Love the book &#34;Pride and Prejudice.&#34; The digital copy for my Kindle makes it perfect for transportation and easy access.	5
For those who love the stories we read as children, now you can have the digital version as well! A Classic that is great both in paper and digital form.	4
My teenage daughter fell in love with this story through the various movies before she read the book in hard cover. Now she loves it on Kindle.	4
I love the old classics and this is one of them. It also downloaded easily to my new windows 8 kindle from the apps store.	4
A classic for all to read. A must for all high school students. There are many lessons to be gotten from this novel.	5
I got this for my daughter. The pretty cover made it more fun to give this amazing classic love story.	4
I have to say that I like this book so far.I have never actually read Pride and Prejudice before but i have seen the movie many times. I have seen the new version of it the 2005 movie.My cousin who is a HUGE Jane Austen fan loves P and P but hates the new movie becaue she says its nothing like the book.I happen to think that its quite similar.Is this the original book? Even if it is not the original i still love this book.and ifit is the original i will still love it!	4
Pride and Prejudice is one of the books I turn to when I need a break from my real life. I love getting caught up with the Bennett family. There's just something about the book...The real reason I'm writing this review is not to dwell on the wonderfulness that is Pride and Prejudice, but to note my slight distraction by the formatting. There were certain spots where lines broke oddly, and strange words that were written in all capital letters. It was often enough to be slightly distracting, but still a good book and a wonderful read (if that sort of thing doesn't bother you too much).	5
Well it's quite simply a classic! I was only 12 when the TV show came on and remember becoming transfixed by it. It propelled me to Austen's books and I haven't looked back since. Simply, a thoroughly good read for anyone who likes a delightful love story and appreciates fine story telling that really gives you a sense of its characters.	4
I love this book. I've gone over it again and again, and I still love it. A couple parts may be tedious at times (like Mr. Collins...blech), but over all, a really good book. Not to mention, this book is pratically free! Two thumbs up!	4
Pride and Prejudice was a fantastic book. I started the book thinking it would be dull and old fashioned. After the first chapter I couldn't put it down. I am now working my way through all of the Jane Austen books and enjoying every word of it.	5
The story is wonderful. A could not put it down.The only negative is the occasional typos (used "-----shire" a lot) and used only one letter initial for names in some areas. Annoying but it was free.	4
A classic tale of the &#34;play hard to get&#34; gets you far! A little hard to read through if your not used to the old english. But never the less a classic tale of the dating game.	4
My fav movie of all time (the one with Colin Firth, of course); now I'm reading the book on my Kindle.	5
I love this book. I read this book 20 years ago and I'm reading it a second time. I love it even more. I plan to read it again in the near future. I just love the two main characters, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. The details of their thoughts make you feel like you know them.	5
Loved it, loved it, loved it!!! Classic romance novel. Had wanted to read this for a long, long time. Moderate amount of 'flowery' writing, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it.	5
Greatest love story of all time. Amazing story. Well written. A true work of art. Very amazing literature and captivating story	5
I was hooked after the first two sentences. I am now surprised at myself that I had not read a single Jane Austen book at nearly 30. I fully intend on reading all of her works. I loved how dialogue based this novel is.	5
I read this for the umpteenth time on the PC Kindle, and the formatting seemed fine to me, so maybe it's been sorted by now. Either that or I was so bedazzled by the story that I simply didn't notice any problems.A librarian once remarked to me, upon my commenting how few people were in the library that particular day, that if people had to pay to gain access the line would be around the block. This seemed to me to display a wise understanding of human nature.Just because something is free does not mean it is worthless, any more than there being a guarantee that something costing a lot is bound to be valuable. The reason this book is always free on Kindle is that it is long out of copyright. This fact alone shows that it has stood the test of time, along with Jane Austen's other novels.Many people shy away from reading so-called classic novels. They feel that they will be full of long descriptions or such dated language that the narrative will be impossible to penetrate. To anyone reading this book for the first time, therefore, the writing will be a revelation. It is perceptive and witty in its social commentary, and full of interesting, sympathetic (and sometimes unsympathetic) characters who remain forever in the memory.The story itself is the great-great-great-grandmother of all romances, even predating Jane Eyre, which so many people liken to Mills & Boon or Silhouette romances. The heroine and her hero are real, flawed people rather than cardboard cutouts. When you consider that Jane Austen's settings and characters genuinely reflect her own time (the late 18th/early 19th century), rather than being researched in modern times, there is added interest from both cultural and historic perspectives.If you have never read this novel, regarded by many as the writer's best, please don't pass on it this time. Not only is it a wonderful experience in itself, but it may open for you literary doors to other fascinating worlds that you have kept firmly closed until now. If you have already read it once, of course, this review is preaching to the converted, for you have probably done so several times, with its charms only increasing with every reading.	5
It is the first book I happened to read on my Kindle. I was afraid the quality may be bad, for it was among the cheap or free classics. It is not the case, the format is very enjoyable. Concerning the book, its fame is sufficient to make clear how nicely written it is. That is definitely the kind of book that make me really enjoy the english language.	5
this version of Pride and Prejudice is authentic and easy to read.The quality of the illustrations do not measure up to the lovely cover though.I use the third sized font and have no problem at all. Bev A Mosley	4
:)Good book!I love the book. She is an excellent writer. I love ALL her books. They are fun to read, and very addictive!	4
I had a mildly (and predictably) upsetting experience once as a substitute teacher in a 10th-grade English class. The topic at hand was Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, and the class was a noisy, disrespectful circus. It may be that this novel is essentially inaccessible now to all but a handful of young readers, and probably many older ones as well. A terrible shame!The book has much to teach us, after all, about the human condition, and the ways in which we handicap ourselves in the pursuit of happiness. Elizabeth's travails, and Mr. Darcy's, are as much self-inflicted as they are levied by the society in which they live. That said, Austen has an exceedingly generous and sympathetic touch with all of her characters, and the novel is one of the funnier pieces of the period. It goes without saying (or should) that her mastery of the English language is without peer.	5
The book is very good (of course! A classic!) Jane Austen is always a great reading.But this book has a lot of typos. I bought the kindle version and the typos were annoying.	2
I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Elizabeth is by far my favorite character. Her temperament is all that I inspire to be.	5
This is my favorite Jane Auten. I got tired of checking it out of the library year-after-year and when I saved enough, I bought it for my own.	5
Fair pricing, Fair delivery charges, quick shipping, accurate descriptions of products and good products delivered.Met all expectations. Thank you so much.	5
Classic story. Wonderful read. I've re-read it so many times, I can't get enough of it! Must read for any book enthusiast.	5
A wonderful read :). This is a book that everyone should read. This is my third reading and , will probably read a few more times :).	5
This is my fourth reading of this book and I become even more enamored of it with every single read!!	4
Jane Austen created Elizabeth Bennett - every respectable man's ultimate woman - and Mr. Darcy - the role model for all gentlemen. She combined romance and wit with real characters and a story that has enchanted every generation since it was published. For some, the language is a barrier, but perseverance will reward any reader with possibly the best book ever written.	5
I went into this very guarded based off of what I heard. I was pleasantly surprised and would suggest anyone that might be a little weary about reading it to give it a try.	4
My all-time favorite book. This story never gets old. Austen is the master when it comes to writing about love of the purest kind. Do yourself a favor and keep this in rotation in your library.	5
People can often be dismissive of chick lit but all you need to do is read Pride and Prejudice to know that books based on men/women and their misunderstandings when done well can't be beaten. I go back to this book at least once a year and it only gets better and better.	5
This is a classic novel everyone should read. Jane Austin is witty and creative, this book is not just for a high school English class.	5
One of the best romances in the world of literature. Every woman wants a Mr Darcy although in the BBC adaptation I actually preferred Bingley ;)	5
I can clearly see why anyone who reads English literature has high praises for this story. I enjoyed everything about it. It was well written, well developed, and well presented that it holds the number one spot in my love of books. The tone of the story, the pace of the story, all very pleasing to me. And the language! I highly recommend this story to all who has a love for books.	5
Two hundred years after it was written this book remains as witty, insightful and entertaining as ever. I cannot recommend it enough!	5
I have read thid book at least three times before. I enjoy it each time I read it. I sympathize with Elizabeth having to deal with her silly mother and two of her sisters. This novel gives the reader insight about what it was like to be a woman in England at the time. The main focus of each young woman's life is finding a good marriage. It makes me greatful that I don't live in this time period.	5
Pretending to 'rate' such an incomparable classic of great literature as Pride & Prejudice is a pretty pointless exercise, in my opinion.	5
For the book I thought it was a good read. I actually only got this book though because my daughter needed to have it for her English class.	5
I am in love with this book. Jane Austen did a fantastic job. I am planning on buying more of he books. :)	5
Great timeless romance! Looking forward to reading another Jane Austen book. I anticipated a happy ending and she delivered. Thanks	5
You really need to use your imagination with this book. Not because the book is badly written, but you have to let yourself go an imagine what it would be like and visualize this in your mind.	4
This book is filled with everything a good book should be. Its funny, serious and romantic. I really recommend it. LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	5
I have now read this lovely book three times, it always makes me smile. I fell in love with story as a child on the 90s watching the BBC version of the book with my mother.	5
Very insightful and fun. Easy to relate to the issues the parents face. The two leads make great role models.	5
An English classic which needs no introduction or explanation! Lovely to have it on Kindle to reread anytime, anyplace, anywhere!	5
Jane Austen was one of the best writers ever. She has written many books and they are all great. She knows how to write and she knows what she's talking about when she writes too. Which is a major plus for her. She can write in different styles. She knows how to write about characters and she can easily make them seem real. When someone writes like that it is so much better because if you feel like the characters are real it's easier for you to really get into the story. It was a little hard to hard to get into at first but once you got into the book you didn't have a choice to read or not because you had already invested most of your time trying to understand the book. I had this problem. I would have liked it better if it was a little bit easier to read, but it was written a long time ago so I really have no room to complain.I thought the book had good context. Elizabeth was a strong and independent female character. She didn't let much pass her and she was mostly on top of things. I really liked the way Jane Austen had made her seem like a well raised, confident, young women who wanted adventure. She made Elizabeth seem real. Like she could really exist back then. I really liked that aspect of her.When she talked about Mr. Darcy you could tell he had so much pride for everything he had and owned. He was almost close to a stuck up snob, but he made him seem more pleasurable than that. You could tell he really did love Elizabeth too. At first she hated him. She wanted nothing to do with him and she got mad every time she saw him, which was conveniently often. Every time Mr. Darcy had tried to help Elizabeth or her family it just turned into a disaster and resulting with her more and more mad at him.I think Elizabeth finally realized how much she loved Mr. Darcy when he saver her little sister, Lydia, and her entire family from total embarrassment. He didn't have to go and save Elizabeth's family but he still did. Just for her. It probably helped that Lydia had run off with the right guy. If she had ran off with some poor guy she just met off the street he probably wouldn't have been able to do much damage control. But no she ran off with Wickham. This was good for their family, I think, because it brought Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy together once again and this time for good. It had to be a plus that he saved her family and made Elizabeth open her eyes to see that Mr. Darcy was the best man for her. Her perfect match. I would guess that after they got married they still fought like crazy, but what couple doesn't?Jane Austen did a wonderful job writing this book. You can tell she was a skilled author and writer. She cared about what she was writing and you could tell that in her books. It was almost as if she was putting a little bit of herself into Pride and Prejudice.Jane Austen wrote other books too, and like this book you can tell she really poured her heart and soul into her book. I will definitely be reading more of her books sooner than later.	3
I absolutely love pride and prejudice. Of course I saw the movie first which I loved so I gave the book a shot and it is so much better then the movie though I will admit a bit hard to read for me. Definitely glad I read it.	5
This romance captures you right from the beginning. Miss Austen, though never married, understood true romance. She describes both Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy so vividly the reader cannot fail to have a pure picture in mind. I would fail to see how anyone could read this novel and not want to start a new romance.	5
A classic novel of youth. Brings back memories of required reading in high school. A must read for any one.	3
I found Pride and Prejudice to be captivating. I thoroughly enjoyed examining the many rules of etiquette from that period and marveled at the established social boundaries, comparing then and now.	5
i read this book not on my kindle, i read the hardcover book so I dont know how the actual kindle book works. But let me tell u the book is awesome. The chracters, the plot, the everything is just awesome! if u do not know if u should read it, let me tell u that u should!!!	5
This offers a smooth and easily navigatable version of this classic.Lizzy Bennett shall always be in my day dreams :-)Chapter links are useful too,on the whole a very useful travel copy.	5
After watching the movie and loving it, I decided to read the book. I enjoyed every minute of reading this book. I would definitely recomend it!!	5
Great service! The purchase was exactly what I ordered and I received it in a timely manner. I am very happy with my book!	5
This is a very good copy of the book. The outside is very pretty and very sturdy (definitely not cheapo cardboard). Also, the paper is high quality. Looks like an antique book without the antique fragility.Received much sooner than expected too, in two weeks instead of the month Amazon said it would take.	5
This is one of my favorite books of all time. If you haven't read it - read it! You'll find yourself rereading it time and time again.	5
This is my favorite Jane Austen story. Her characters, Lizzy and Darcy, are so romantically written. A perfect anytime read.	5
Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a classic of English literature for good reason. The characters, especially Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy are quite well drawn. One of the best aspects of the novel is the vantage point from which it is written.The reader learns everything through Elizabeth Bennet's point of view and sees the world through her prejudices. The point of view broadens as Elizabeth develops as a character and loses her prejudices, particularly against Mr. Darcy.Pride and Prejudice continues to be extremely popular and inspires many spin-offs including Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. Its influence on English literature and its continued appearance in popular culture alone make it worth reading.Trev @ trevsliteraryreview.blogspot.com	4
This is a really good story, it has been revised, so I was a little disappointed by that. I've been wanting an unabridged text, but this is still really good. A fun read.	4
What a wonderful unexpected love story! The art of which the author incorporated the economical push on relationships was done very well!	5
Obviously Jane Austen was amazing and Pride and Prejudice is incredible. But WHY would they put this cover on it? Why take a classic and make it look trashy? It looks like Lauren Conrad wrote this book... I am disgusted with the publishers.	5
This is a timeless classic that I recommend for every one to read at least once in their lifetime. Jame Austen is a great author and writer.	5
I have read this book three times and just do not seem to tire of it. It's not only a great classic, but it's readable and often amusing with well-rounded characters and a delightful plot.	5
This book is amazing. Mr.Darcy and Lizzie are pure literary masterpeices. I fell in love with this book a year ago and have read it 5 times since. This is no doubt my obsession and if you have never read it I recommend it entirely. My only complaint is that it ended.	5
This book held me in suspense and although its wording was a little complicated. it drew me in all the more.	5
I enjoyed this. recommend this purchase. I enjoyed this. recommend this purchase. I enjoyed this. recommend this purchase. I enjoyed this. recommend this purchase. +	3
I am not much for writing reviews let alone writing more then a few words and don't like it when forced to so It's okay. Maybe it is the cover.	3
detail and descriptive language. Some of the material in the book was pertinent to todays life. Hard to believe it was written 200 yea ago.	5
This book was fun but long.I'm sort of an impatient reader, plus I'm more of an action packed book reader,but it was masterfully written.If I have to read a book about tea and dances this is the one I'd pick.It's pretty fun for a Romance and I found myself hoping she would find her prince.Pride and prejudice is about a girl from a family of like four sisters and no brothers, so their all knight in shining armour chasers except for their father who manages to remain sane.If you like the book you might also like the movie.I know I do, I had a hard time getting through the book.But like I said I'm an impatient reader and I'd prefer to read the Lord of the rings or I am number four.	3
Very good book. Understand why it has stood the test of time and movies have been made of this classic.	5
Such a change from all the vulgar books out these days, easy to see why it's a classic. Loved it	5
I have been reading Pride and Prejudice every few years for the past thirty years at least. It is always a pleasure. The Kindle version gives me one more access to a book that I love. The characters in this novel have endured the test of time for a reason. They were well thought out and developed by a master of her craft. Every time that I read it I feel as though I am visiting old friends.William E Sherrill,	5
I'm only giving a 1 star review because of the single issue referenced in my review title (it would be lovely to have separate 'formatting' reviews). It applies only to the edition of P&P; with ASIN 'B008476HBM' (Pride and Prejudice) and only on basic Kindle, Paperwhite, and Kindle Touch (these pay attention to language attributes so as to use a 'matching' dictionary).This happens to be the only edition of P&P; enabled for WhisperSync for Voice (with a free audiobook available from Audible) which is why I got this edition and have discovered this issue.Otherwise, the formatting is good, and (so far as I've read) free of typos. The price is right. And of course, the story is great, and everybody should read it.It seems the language attribute for the book is not set to 'English' and so (again only on K/KT/KPW) one gets 'Dictionary Not Found" even though an English dictionary is available. On my Kindle Touch, it does a lookup in the Italian dictionary that I happen to have on there (and of course fails to find these English words). Dictionary lookup works fine on my Fire and I'm guessing on Kindle Keyboard and older Kindles, which always use the one and only default dictionary.It is probably possible to edit the language attributes (e.g. with calibre) so that it works correctly. But that only fixes that instance. Fresh downloads from Amazon will still have this problem, at least until it is fixed.	1
Haven't read it all so I can't really say if I like it or love it. Maybe when I get a chance to read more of it I'll know how I like it.	3
A classic that should be read once in your life. However, I'm glad to move on to bigger and better things.	3
I had wanted this book for a whole because it looked pretty on the picture but I never imagined how truly gorgeous it would be. You can feel the material and it's just looks great. The print is a great reading size and I love that it gives you references to words, places and traditions of the time to better understand the story.	5
I have not read the book yet, however I think ones opinion of the book is just that, ones opion. I am reviewing the quality of the book I received from the seller, which was great! Delivered on time as well! Love buying used books from Amazon!	5
I am decidedly not a fan of Austen, but my boyfriend specifically asked for this edition for Christmas. It is part of an excellent series of Penguin Classics that are being re-released with superb cover art. Normally cover art bears only a fleeting relation to the actual content of the book, but the covers in this series are all very fitting for their books. The pages are nicely weighty, and the cover art continues on the inside flaps of the cover.	4
Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen was assigned to me at my University. It was the first English classic book I read while getting my degree. Pride and Prejudice was a part of my English Literature class. At first I didn't want to read it, but a few pages in I really enjoyed it and now have read other books by her.The book made strong my belief that love overcomes everything. The characters of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are so well drawn out, slow and with meaning. They are characters you will fall in love with. It's funny how at first they don't like each other but come to appreciate each other	4
Pride and Prejudice is my second favorite Jane Austen (Sense and Sensibility is number one) and has as fantastic characters and plot. Both are classics, a must read for anyone who likes a good love story.	5
Pride and Prejudice. We all know it as a timeless classic and it's difficult to review. What can I say that hasn't already been said? Thus, I'll continue.Lizzy Bennett: She's grown up in a humble and somewhat poor family. The only people she really see's eye to with in her family are her father and her sister. She's stubborn, passionate and proud of her family and life style.Darcy: He's grown up in a rich family and taught that he is the best as far as social interaction. His parents have since died and he is extremely close to his only and younger sister. He's persistent, quiet and sure he is the highest ranking person.So when the two meet, they're not exactly fond of each other. In fact, there's immediately animosity on both ends. They don't really expect to see each other often until Darcy's best friend falls for Elizabeth's sister. Inevitably they are brought together on numerous occasions. And as time goes by his feeling toward her change drastically.I realize that I could never give the story justice. It's classic for a reason. Beautifully written and surprisingly easy to relate to. It is also a great insight for the time period. A must read.	5
The novel Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen intrigued me just by its mysterious title in which the two seemingly irrelevant words are put together. After I finished the first reading, I was impressed with her witty and sophisticated language that enlivened the characters with distinctive features and the descriptions of landscapes and atmospheres of that certain time period. Moreover, the most remarkable aspect of this novel was the title itself- Pride and Prejudice. The two words do not agree upon a uniform theme but after the reading, I could make multiple links between the plots/themes of the novel and the title. The only aspect I did not really enjoy was how the basic structure of the entire essay was stereotypical and the plots being somewhat hackneyed to the readers who are exposed to a wide range of romance novels.Before I started the novel, I could not really expect in advance what would happen and how the characters would advance. However, as I finished up the novel, my curiosity was fully disentangled. Some readers may interpret the title as Darcy being the proud character and Elizabeth being the prejudiced character. However, from another perspective, one can also interpret the title as that both characters are prejudiced by their first impressions and their social classes and are blinded by their pride, which explains why they both continue to be put in a form of conflict. Either way, the title lets the readers expect something that they have never thought and thus turns the thing around after the reading, which maximizes the dramatic aspects of all.Jane Austen's use of language is certainly highly sophisticated and classy especially when she describes the background scenes or setting of 18th century of England. Without watching movies, I could easily imagine each scene vividly. When she describes Longbourn, a typical country town, or Darcy's estate, it gave me right away an impression of what it was like during that epoch. Also, not only her picturesque and descriptive language, but her actualizations of the atmosphere of that certain era were directly conveyed to me that I once thought I was one of those daughters of Bennet family. She uses lots of details to offer the most explicit mood of realistic lives of an ordinary family in England and she successes regard to that.Austen's characters and perspectives are also some aspects that did captivate me a lot. The protagonists Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy stand out as very distinctive characters but minor charactors such as Jane, Bingley, Collins, Wickham, Lydia, Lady Catherine, and even her parents play tasteful roles that keep the novel stimulating until the end. The setting and background of this novel is something to focus on also because the lives of people in England during 18th-19th century were typical while the novel and plots deviate from such clich&eacute; by Austen making characters unique and distinguished. Elizabeth Bennet is unlike other women who were expected to be obedient and passive; Elizabeth seems vigorous in expressing her opinions, honest, straightforward and intelligent (and problematically she knows it too well). In a scene where Elizabeth confronts Lady Catherine, she does not fall back or cringes due to her lower class, but rather, she stands up defending herself and remain confident in saying what she wants to say to Lady Catherine. Her unique characteristic definitely explains why Darcy is so attracted to her in the first place.Austen integrates basic components of the lives of ordinary people naturally so that the readers today can easily compare their lives to that of old live and easily understand and even sympathize with the characters. She makes several conflicts between different class such as between Elizabeth and Lady Catherine or Ms. Bingley looking down on Jane to demonstrate how class distinction was so conspicuous during that time period. Also, the typical mindsets of women are displayed when Mrs. Bennet is very desperate to let all her five children be married to rich men or when Elizabeth's friend, Charlotte marries to Mr. Collins even without love. It was a prevalent thought back then that love is not the most chief determinant in marriage (This is why Elizabeth-Darcy relationship is more enthralling). The readers today can easily perceive what it was like in England by reading the novel and place themselves in the middle of the setting. Nonetheless, along with this, it was also an intriguing component that Austen used four different couples to demonstrate that diverse situations allowing the readers to compare.Except the fact that the basic structure of the novel was formulaic, I enjoyed the novel and I would like to recommend to those of my age because anyone of my age could easily relate to Elizabeth and be easily impressed by her attractive characteristics and eye-catching development of Elizabeth and Darcy's beautiful relationships.	4
It wasn't hard to not like, but it is introduced to me by my mom. In fact, it is her favorite translated books and so well known, it connected us to a time where everyone still cared about society decorum. It was more about finding love and still believe domestic live is still good for reason. It made women look good but made the truth more bearable about the constant bickering around home. It explained like Mr. Roger in the Neighborhood about who is coming and going in the social circle, and it made serious strive to explain the role of women in society and politics, but it did not aim to increase their role. It was a cup of tea on the role of gentlemen in their children's education, and it made their role around home more explainable. It made warring segment of the society less popular, but it reflected the sentiment of the times, it made peace more acceptable and finding the person to share life more condoned. It was the voice of the unpopular and the bluestocking type of "Jane" at the time, who wants their men to stay home and their women to enjoy the social life more. It is nothing but deplorable people who marry unsuitably and this reasoning made it ways to every nook and craning, essentially, it set out to destroy as much of unsuitable marriage as possible. But it did this elegantly, and the main character there, Elizabeth and Darcy, as well as Jane and Bingley as good as married. It does not seek to destroy any more thinking process on the other facets of the ordinary life in unordinary times, but it brought unrealized expectations as well. The thoughts of English ways does not prevail in their society is like reducing the mind to think only of the times they were conquered by the Normans, but it does not however, make the case for the natural ways people will continue to live their life as much as possible. So, at the end, everyone hoorayed at the English marriages and made sure whoever named Eliza will marry Fitzwilliam Darcy in the End, and not anyone forgot about Jane as well.The less known character then all got their satisfaction and knowledge that they all had their share of matrimony of stable life, which in fact, is the well-known intent of Jane Austen in almost every single one of her books. Perhaps all of them, though their maybe one or two which is read by the reviewer or because it is only partially finished. Most like the latter.So, who really cares about the malapropism of the weaker characters or the seldom attuned to reality Eliza, it was actually more fun to read it and not have to over think on who could possibly love the Darcy and Bingley set of the world. It was so well described, and it made the whole Bingley and friends' family the most beloved or the most hated family of all time. It made their social gatherings the crown of the gazette, all to serve and divert the attentions of the war. It also made some of their actions unforgiving at the same time as well, so in as much as the Bennet family created happiness by entertaining their social circles, it made the Bingley family more unimpeachable when the made the match for their son, right when they made the error of crossing over their duties their neighbors for more frivolous things like work and better gain for themselves.Reading through Pride and Prejudice is also a worrisome venture when in fact the reader is often at a loss on how to cope with the idea that Jane Austen herself is at the lower level of the society, without either access to explain their actual lives or scientific tools to deduce on how people like the unforgiving aunt of Darcy. It took witticism and it took the audacity to write based on hearsay, and it made philosophy more acceptable to women, perhaps. Least in my opinion it did.	5
I couldn't find anywhere whether or not this was an abridged or unabridged version. I found out when the book on CD got here that it's abridged...not what I wanted at all. Although it lasted a car ride back home from school, I would prefer to listen to the whole book, not a synopsis.	3
I give this an average rating for the poor editing. The font was fine, but there were so many typos. That said, it was the first Kindle book I ordered because this is my favorite book of all time. I love the book so much, I kept reading through the typos and that's not easy for me. It was free, however. I guess you get what you pay for, right?	3
Still a great story;even after multiple readings. Timeless. Will read it again in the future. A personal favorite of Jane Austen"s work.	5
There is only one thing that I think really says it all.... You can't go wrong with Jane Austin. :	5
There is just something special about holding a book in your hands to read it and not staring at a computer screen.	5
I found P and P to be extremely slow at first, but became excellent from the middle to the end.	4
Great story for anyone who has had to deal with the convoluted workings of a family. Meeting new people, making friends, or falling in love is never easy and it's made even more difficult by the human failing of not being able to be open and honest with others from the beginning of the new relationships. This book is more than a window to the past, it is a relevant look at how many relationships florish or fail in our own times.	5
Just an amazing book com the older days to read and the characters are so superb in actions and words	5
Titles as old as this are often found to be dry and boring to present day youth. Pride and Prejudice is something to be read by all teens. By choice hopefully.	5
Pride and Prejudice, I can now say, is a classic for a reason. Though hard to understand at times for the old style of writing, it is a very entertaining story that I believe is worth the effort. (I must admit that I was able to follow along better because I have seen the movie, which can act as a guide.)	5
I hadn't read this for many, many years. It's amazing how a life perspective can enhance something I thought I knew already.	5
This is the first book by Jane Austen I have read. It was thoroughly enjoyed. I will be reading more by this author.	5
When I started this book, I must say, it was with dragging feet. It was assigned to me for school and I was prepared for a sappy romance story, probably with big words, like most classics. The first half seemed to be living up to my expectations, minus the big words. In fact, it was so simply written that I began to wonder why it was called a classic at all. I know I may be speaking blasphemy according to some people, but all I could think in the beginning was that this was some twaddle about a bunch of giggly girls from the Victorian era! Then the middle came. At just about the exact middle of the book, things got interesting. Tension was rising; emotions were running like a river through rapids, and I was hooked. I suddenly found myself reading more chapters than I was assigned to that week, and of all the books I had to read in a week, that was the first one I picked up. I can't tell you any more specifically what grabbed me for fear of giving too much away, but I will tell you this: it may take awhile to get there, but it's well worth the wait. Once I had finished it I had to go back and read all my favorite parts! Now I, who sneered at Austen at the first, am planning on reading "Sense and Sensibility" over the summer. Austen, you have me converted!	5
One of the best classic books around. A love story of classes and impossible love. I would recommend the book and see the movie.	5
I believe for girls this is a must read/ watch. This one though was actually a gift to someone so I can't judge how it worked.	5
Jane Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice is, in my opinion, one of her best works. It includes the story of a family who holds the possibility of falling into financial trouble. In order to maintain financial stability and remain in line with the standards of society, the daughters are pushed into marriage. This novel recurrently explores the theme of if one should marry for true love or if it is acceptable for the daughters to marry in order to fit in with society and attain financial security. Jane Austen does a great job expressing the ideals of her society in a creative and interesting manner through her novel.	5
This book is, of course, a timeless classic. Beautifully written. I haven't read it in years, but look forward to reading it again on my Kindle.	5
This was the first time I had read one of Jane Austen's novels, and I am so enthralled with the story-telling and characters I am now looking to read every single thing she has written. The writing is filled with so many different layers; not only do I find bits of humor in a re-read that I missed the first time around, but the characters themselves are so different and have so much depth that you could easily imagine these people exist (or have existed) in real life.The dialogue is where this novel shines, which is good since the novel is mostly dialogue. Austen is able to convey the personality of a character simply through the way the character speaks, so that even though there are not a lot of descriptions of the characters, you have a clear idea of who each character is almost as soon as they open their mouth. Perhaps one of my favorite aspects of the writing style is the sandpaper-dry wit of Austen, which, when you understand it, can be very, very funny.Note that it may not be for everyone: since this book was written in the early 1800s, some of the turns of phrases are outdated, and may be difficult for a modern reader to understand. Another stumbling block is that while the writing itself is elegant and beautiful, the sheer density of words might make it hard for some people to read. For the former, my recommendation is to read as closely as possible, and re-read passages you didn't quite get the first time around; this will have the added benefit that you may be able to catch wisps of Austen's dry humor you might have missed the first time (I know I did). For the latter, it's a matter of preference. Personally, I love how poetic and elegant the writing is, and finding the hidden tidbits of humor as well as the ever-present underlying issues of the time was always rewarding to me; but if you find after the first chapter or two that you just can't get through the density of the writing, this may not be a good read for you.Since I downloaded the Kindle version, here's a review of the e-book format specifically: I did not notice any typos (yay!); it had a list of chapters near the beginning of the book, right after the cover, but does not contain an actual "table of contents" function. (i.e., if you click on "Go to..." the "table of contents" button will be grayed out.) Page numbers are included and total at 253; and for those who care, there are ten "Popular Highlights" at this time of writing, half of which are grouped around pages 12-15.	5
Pride and PrejudiceLove Jane Austen Have seen the movie many times and read the book so much more exciting to read the book and let your mind visualize the settings. If you like Jane Austen the you will enjoy this book	5
great story, great characters, well written (of course) and just a joy to read over again. ,, .. ... ..	5
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a reader would find that books worth reading are worth reading twice and Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is definitely one of them.Pride and Prejudice is actually the first classic book I've ever read from cover to cover. Since I'm not used to reading classics during that time, it took me ages before I get the hang of the story and eventually finish it. Nevertheless, I was able to appreciate the story and it instantly became my favorite. Well, who would not fall in love with the story of Lizzie and Mr. Darcy?Three years later, this book was chosen as the featured book for the October face-to-face discussion of my book club and so I decided to read it again since I wasn't able to retain most of the details of the story in my memory. It was worth reading twice indeed for I find it sweeter the second time around. For some weird reason, I am really a fan of love-hate story and it was only when I read this book the second time that I realized that this is the best love-hate story I've read so far. It was also in my second time that I was able to appreciate more the care-free character of Elizabeth Bennet, the snob-outside-but-soft-inside character of Mr. Darcy, the annoying character of Mrs. Bennet and the cool father character of Mr. Bennet.Pride and Prejudice is truly an enduring classic so no wonder it became one of the most popular books in English literature and inspired most of the novels of today and became the favorite subject for film and tv adaptations.	5
Even though the language can be a challenge for me at times, I've ways loved this book! It is just a classic story that has defiantly withstood time and change!!	5
A must read. Sometimes the greatest loves begin when and were we least expect it. Jane Austen, one of my favorite writers,surely ahead of her time!!!!!!	5
Just like Sense and Sensibility, I bought this for the amazing cover design, designed by talented letterer Jessica Hische. It's a beautiful addition to any library.	5
Wonderful story...after seeing the movie..I just had to read the book...so worth it!! The characters came alive in full glory. Loved it.	5
This is by far my favorite Jane Austen book. Her characters are fabulous and easily come to life from the page. Elizabeth Bennet is very charming and witty and you can't help but root for her and her zany family.	5
I would recommend this book! I bought this one and then got every other Austen book ever written because I love the romance and time period.	5
The one thing I noticed is 18th century communication.It was much more a part of life than the lack of communicationtoday. People thought before speaking, gained knowledgeabout another person through communication. It's sad to thinkThat now we text more, and communicate less.Sad, very sad.	5
I bought this as a gift and it was perfect! It arrived very quickly and was exactly like it was described!!	5
I had to read this book for AP Literature class, and it was a really good book! One of the classics.	5
cannot wait for the sequel to this book. the sequel was apparently written by PD James and is on my list of books to purchase.	5
Should have read a long time ago. Did not really know what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. Chosen because is a classic.	4
Admittedly, I'm a Jane Austen fan. That said, I think Pride and Prejudice is the best book she ever wrote. The characters are well-drawn and internally consistent, and the story line flows with a sense of inevitability. Oh, yes, I read everything Jane wrote, and almost all of it with pleasure, but I return to reread Pride and Prejudice every year or two for the sheer pleasure of doing so. And what better way to do it than via Kindle?	5
If you haven't read this book yet, you really must do so! I never read any Jane Austen in school etc, and just out of nowhere picked up "Pride and Prejudice" recently. It instantly became my new favorite book. The characters are captivating, the story is enthralling, and it'll leave you wanted to go back and read it again. I warned my husband, though, that I'm not in love with another man.. and his name is Mr. Darcy :)	5
Pride and Prejudice is simply timeless, I reread it this Summer for the first time since high school and somehow I learned to appreciate Jane Austen's work even more.	5
I can not even begin to write the review that this book deserves. My only regret is that I didn't read this book sooner! If you enjoy a good love story then you MUST read this book! The characters were so well developed and the story was so well delivered that it was virtually impossible to put it down. In my opinion, this book deserves way more than 5 stars.	5
I have always had a soft in my heart for Jane Austen. In fact, I can not say that there is any of her books that I do not like. About a month ago, I received my first kindle, as a graduation gift, from my boyfriend. I have to say at first I was very uncomfortable with using it because it just seemed like it would be very hard to read from it. I hate reading off the computer. However, I promised him that I would try. However, with this experiment I did not want to waste money on a book that I may never read from the piece of equipment. After searching Amazon I found the free section of ebooks and was delighted to find my tried and true author amoung those. This was the first ebook I had heard and though it has been many years and still enjoy it, greatly. Plus, I found that the kindle was right up my alley.Thanks, Jane; for giving me a book that never fails to capture my attention.	4
This story is one of the greatest pieces of English literature to ever be written. It may take some time to actually get hooked to the book, but once you do, don't count on putting it down. The tension between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy leave you wanting more. The love in the story leaves you speechless. It's a battle between the rich families and the poor families. I loved the book because it is a beautiful story that deals with tension, love, heartbreak and so much more! Also, the version of this book is easy to understand. The book is amusing, well written and I highly recommend it!	5
I could read P&P; over and over again, watch a million film adaptations, and never get sick of the seething love story behind it. The story of Elizabeth & Darcy is what all fiercely independent women (or those of us who would like to become such) dream of -- uncompromising love with a man who is somehow both kind and sexy and equal in every way.No one does romance like the Brits, and most subsequent romance stories are just rehashing the tales of Austen, Bronte, and the like.	5
*happy sigh. I mean, really, do I need to say much more than that? I can't quite put my finger on what it is about Pride and Prejudice's happily ever after that goes above and beyond your average HEA. It could be because it has quite a few of my favorite plot devices in it. Austen certainly balances them all very well. At no point does one seem to outweigh the other. In one novel you have: a grievous assumption of character, manipulative sisters, a scandalous elopement, a dysfunctional yet mostly lovable family and the heroine who marries up.I think my favorite story arc is the same as everyone else. I love watching Elizabeth Bennet get smacked upside the head by love. I adore Darcy for not being aggressive in trying to win over Elizabeth. Instead he showed her who he could be. In one instance he wasn't guaranteed Elizabeth would ever know about his act of kindness. In fact he didn't want anyone to know. Their love story is both epic and legendary.I'll admit it took some time to understand the dialogue. Once I did, I found one of the greatest love stories ever written.	5
i really love this book! i liked the movie with keira. (i never was into the whole pirates of the caribbean) i saw the movie first and then got the book from a bookstore, and when i got my kindle i downloaded the book so i could re-read it when i had craving for a pride and prejudice fix. i can read this book over and over.the only problem that i see is the formatting and that is why it is a 4 star, i really think it is the kindle itself because i have the pc kindle and everything is just the way it is in the book.	4
like Pride and Prejudice. I really do. It's one of my favorite novels. But, I must confess, it's not my favorite Jane Austen novel. I like both Persuasion and Emma better and Sense and Sensibility is very, very close.I first read the book when I was 14 and I absolutely loved Elizabeth Bennet and her sharp wit. I really liked Darcy too, but everyone paled in comparison to Elizabeth. I thought the story was incredibly romantic. I even thought Mr. Bennet was a doll. I saw the 1995 version very shortly after I finished the book and my opinions were less than favorable. But that's a review for another day.My opinion has changed over the years and frequent rereads. I saw what a bad father and husband Mr. Bennet really was. I still like Elizabeth and Darcy, but mostly because they are dynamic characters who mature and grow to become a worthy couple. I find Elizabeth quite immature and a bit too sure of herself in the beginning and Darcy to be on the controlling side. They are both proud and both prejudiced in the beginning but I do like that they learn from their mistakes and change.The book is a delightful comedy of manners. But I more highly admire Elinor Dashwood, Anne Elliot, and even Fanny Price than Elizabeth Bennet. And I'd take Frederick Wentworth, Henry Tilney, Mr. Knightley, or Colonel Brandon over Darcy. Although the 10,000 a year does work in his favor...	5
I read this book a few years ago, and it is one of my favorites of all time! the characters are very detailed and believable, and the plotline is very interesting and dramatic without being totally unbelievable. having wanted one guy before discovering that another one was my match myself, I totally relate to this book. I also find the 17th-century culture aligned in the book interesting, such as the fact that girls were forced to marry for economic reasons by a certain age, often with men that they were not in love with. This book paints an amazing portrait of what 17th-century life was like, with all of its balls and activities, along with an amazing love story.	5
I watched the movie and expected the book to be much the same. The book has way too much talk in it, hardly anything is described in any other way than by someone remarking upon it. But I liked the story overall, and I thought the authors view on pride was interesting. The characters are believable and somewhat relatable. Some parts were hard to understand because the language is outdated, and I wasn't always sure who was speaking. Only that someone always was. But because of the social nature of the novel, I guess that works.	4
*This is not a good Kindle version. It doesn't load well and is difficult to read as parts are cut off or wrap oddly.Even though it's free, it's not worth it. It's too frustrating trying to navigate and read.I'd spend a bit of money and get a better version, or better yet, buy the actual book, or even better, buy both. This has got to be one of the most romantic stories of all time.If you're not a Jane Austin fan, you will be within a few moments of entering into her world.For those of you unfamiliar with the story ~ (Do people like that even exist?) ~ Here is a brief summaryThe story takes place in Victorian England. We meet the Bennett family, the mother's sole intent is to marry her daughters off to successful men, ensuring they will be cared for properly since only males can inherit property. The story focuses on Elizabeth Bennett, the second daughter, who is attractive, but not as attractive as her older sister ~ She is also witty, smart, well-read and confident. Now we meet the wonderful Mr. Darcy. He is handsome and rich, but quite prideful and arrogant and rude. He is intrigued by Miss Elizabeth Bennett although he can't really figure out why. She mocks and teases him, and doesn't seem at all impressed with him, like every other female who has crossed his path.Throw in some other characters that help carry the story and you now have in your hands the most wonderful and romantic story ever written.Hmmm ~ perhaps I'm a bit biased. Get it, buy it, borrow it. However you get your hands on this book, read it and fall in love.	1
I am happy to finally have read it. It is a lovely read that is worthy of being deemed a classic.	5
I would be shocked if anyone reading this had never heard of the book before or seen any of the many movies about it, but just in case this is one of the best love stories ever written. An absolute must read. There are some unfamiliar words but if you have a dictionary you should be fine. It is wonderful!!	5
As good as I remembered! Wish we were as clever with our wit and as gracious in our feelings toward each other as most of these characters are!!	5
A classic, beautiful love story. So much more information than films. Could not put it down. recommended highly to any proficient reader.	5
Long read but I read it on a road trip to help pass the time. I love the love between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.	5
I had to read this for Lit by Women in college, but I have read it many times before. This is Jane Austen's second novel, and her most famous. It is a wonderful story. Everyone should read it!	5
The language in this novel is beautiful. The story is compelling. I wish all books of this nature were required reading.	5
This edition works smoothly on a Kindle. There are no awkward gaps or strange spacing problems.As to the content of the novel and the style of its telling, nothing I could say would add materially to its nearly universal veneration.	5
There are numerous errors in this Kindle version of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Most of them are simple copyediting mistakes but occasionally dropped words entirely change the meaning of a sentence.This is NOT the way to experience one of the greatest novels in the English language. Amazon says that you save $3 and change by downloading this free Kindle version but what you lose is much more than that.This ebook should be replaced. Students should consult a professionally published version (Penguin, Oxford University Press) before writing papers or using quotations.	1
Though the language used throughout this book, is the stilted,formal verbiage of an era long past; the charm and humor of the protagonists is readily recognized. The first time I read this book, was a required reading for a literature class. Being a more "mature" reader, has greatly increased enjoyment of this volume.	5
I will not go as far as saying this is one of my favorites. However, it is a classic that demands respect and carries with it all the elements of a good read.	4
Admittedly, I purchased this collection of books not because I wanted to read the book, but because I am a huge fan of Jessica Hische (she designed the drop caps on the covers) and so I felt it really important to have them. I'm reading the books now too (they're great, glad I've got them to read as I find time) but the design is truly beautiful. The hardcover book has a gorgeous aqueous / soft matte coating, and it's almost as if the letters/ cover text are screened on top. Really beautiful. One should note that the page edges are also painted to match the color of the cover, so this book's page edges are red. The book is wonderfully typeset so it's very easy to read. I'm so pleased with my purchase. I've purchased A-F (the only ones available at present, and will undoubtedly purchase the entire collection. Not only will I have a gorgeous collection of books by one of my favorite designers, but I'll be reading classic works. There's nothing better!	5
Never being a fan of the classics, I was delightfully shocked at how much I enjoyed this book. Jane Austen has converted me and I now find myself in possession of all of her wonderful books now. What I thought would be a dreadful endurance has turned into a new favorite of mine and opened my eyes to the wonders that this amazing author has to offer. This is a great book for everyone willing to read it!	5
Pride and Prejudice is just one of those books that I love to read over and over again. It is one of the best romance books ever. In fact, my favorite romance book, Jane Eyre is written by the same author.	5
A classic, this book is a great pleasure to myself and I would recommend it to anyone fond of literature and able to understand higher level reading. Besides, who doesn't love the classics?	3
The greatest love story of all times! I can't help but love everything by Jane Austen! Wonderful characters, wonderful read, the movie does it no justice	5
Difficult at first, but soon after enjoyed the love story. Loved Elizabeth's character and Jane. Darcy was frustrating! Mrs. Bennett was quite comical!	3
not a kindle fan. downloaded because it was free. didnt redownload the app on my new phone and anyways, this was all messed up, pages not in order.	1
The book speaks for itself. One of the greatest works ever created. It is no wonder that Jane Austen and her novels are still revered today.	5
I made a decision to read a lot of the older books that I did not read when I was younger. I'm really glad that I chose to read this one. I would highly recommend this book if you haven't read it!	5
I purchased this free book to try out my new Kindle.This book is a true classic and every bit as enjoyablea read as when I first read it forty years ago!	5
This is my favorite novel and Jane Austin is my favorite author. I read it first time at my teenage. I have read it many times and every time I got new experience.	5
If you- are over 20s- want to have a girlfriend- can't understand womenthen you must read this book.Also it is free for a while. ;)	5
I don't know what took me so long to read this book. I loved it. While most of my friends would not see how funny this book really is or understand the romance of it, I found it one of the best books I have ever read. Obviously.	5
This book lives up to what it is supposed to be--a classic love story. I can easily identify with and like the main character, Elizabeth. Throughout the book, I find it's easy to sympathize with her when she's embarrassed by her family or angry with Darcy. I feel her love for her sister. And, of course, I feel her anger and dislike for Darcy and the feelings of attraction and love that start to take their place. This is a love story. If you want to read a love story, read this book. If you're not interested in that type of thing, then pass this up. I promise you, though, that if you're interested in reading a simple love story, then this is a great one.	5
But I'm going to read it now and find out--have just in fact borrowed the book itself this minute from me local library where Pat, a woman as it turns out and a reference librarian to boot, procured a paperback edition from the stacks and placed it right beside me here at the computer which I have to use now in the library coz I don't yet have a box of rocks installed back in the hut. I do have a clock and a radio though. And a calendar too although strictly speaking that particular item is made out of paper. I do believe that I am going to bigly dig Pride and Prejudice in any case, hence the bold five stars. Well for starters it's considered a classic, innit? Plus I am very favourably disposed towards this writer on account of having read and thoroughly enjoyed some years ago the very bleeding brilliant Persuasion. That truly is a lovely book that is and an abiding pleasure to read. The BBC made a great film version of Persuasion too so they did, in the middle 90s and not long after I savoured this memorable novel for the first time, with deeply satisfying turns by Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. That little flick still strikes all the right notes for me. And so happily on to P&P.	5
This is the unabridged 1945 Hardcover (cloth) Book Club edition - which means it's just as great as it should be, since it IS Pride & Prejudice, but also that the book club-iness makes it not as valuable as it looks. This version has full page colored pictures of the characters through-out, and has that traditional deckled edge (uneven cut pages - makes it easier to turn pages imho).The book is a cute love-story about Elizabeth Bennett and Fitzwilliam Darcy set in that classic early 1800's English period where manners and one's dictated social existence means far more than independence and general happiness. You HAVE to take into the account the current society of the time period / location to understand the predicaments. The story is witty, albeit wordy but still very enjoyable even after ~200+ years.THIS is the version I was looking for, hard cover, ancient looking and good quality! Perfect for my personal PHYSICAL library! I have the Kindle version and yes, that comes with a huge amount of spelling errors and paragraphs broken up mid-sentence. BUT the Kindle edition is FREE a good deal of the time so you end up getting what you paid for... ;)	5
Firstly, I've changed the page count. With the additional notes and whatnot, the book is the number of pages first listed. The story itself is the number in the parentheses.On to the review! I'd always loved the Pride and Prejudice movie; the one from 2005 (I've never seen the really long one). I automatically fell in love with the story, just because I'm such a romantic and found everything about the characters and story so incredibly sweet. Finally, I dragged myself to Borders and forced myself (slash my mother, because I'm broke, hahah) to finally buy the book. I was not disappointed. I love old-fashioned stories, with old-fashioned language and learning about how they did things way back then. It's entertaining on all levels! Mrs. Bennet, though, could drive any sane person crazy, but she's leveled out by Mr. Bennet and her two sensible daughters, Elizabeth and Jane.The love story between Darcy and Elizabeth is priceless; I can see why this book is considered such a classic. However, this isn't a book to be recommended to someone who doesn't like lengthy descriptions and can't really translate nineteenth century speaking into modern day language. You will not understand a thing that is going on. If you read young adult romances and nothing else, this isn't the book for you. For the more mature teenager and adults who love a classic, read on!Read the specifics?[...]~Thalia Anderson	5
P & P is one of my favorite books. The characters are easy to relate to and often lovable. It's an honest and humorous read. I own it in paperback but I had to have it on my kindle. It's an obvious classic and should never be rated less than a five.	5
I did read this book in school (many years ago) and had forgotten much about the book. How important family is and what we in today's world take for granted, love and family.	5
One of the best reads this summer. Great writing, story brings you back in time when people actually had manners.	5
It's just one of the best book I've ever read! Love it! And the movies are great too. Strongly recommended to read.	5
"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."That's probably one of the most famous opening sentences of a novel, along with Moby Dick. Pride and Prejudice is also probably one of Jane Austen's most famous novels. I certainly liked it much more than Northanger Abbey. It is the story of Elizabeth Bennet, who lives with five sisters, and an odd pair of parents at Longbourn. Her mother is constantly scheming about marrying off her daughters to wealthy young men, so when Netherfield Park is let to the rich Mr. Bingley, she is very excited indeed. (Mr. Bennet's estate will be entailed away from the immediate family upon his death, so at least one of the sisters has to marry well to provide for them.) And Mr. Bingley brings his very proud friend, Mr. Darcy. The book is about the courtships, and, of course, has many twists and turns. Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley, Mr. Wickham, and I suppose, the detestable Mr. Collins (who the estate will be entailed to) are the main men of the story.I really loved this one; it had humor and wit in it, and great characters. I enjoyed Mr. Bennet and his sarcasm very much, though Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are really too silly sometimes. So stupid. And of course, Elizabeth. She is really a very smart and spirited young woman, who will not be ordered around. I also watched the 1995 TV series from BBC, and I must confess, Mr. Darcy...never mind.Anyway, all the characters were well portrayed, and while the TV series is wonderful, it doesn't quite have the subtlety of the conversations in Pride and Prejudice itself. The TV series did have excellent casting though; all the Bennets, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Collins were portrayed very well. (Yes, I suppose this is sort of a double review.) I would say though, that Caroline Bingley should have been a little prettier; she was just hideous, and Mr. Bingley was kind of silly-looking. But everywhere else, they did very well.Back to the book. As I said, there were many twists and turns which made this one a thoroughly enjoyable read. And really great characters. Though she is certainly less descriptive and florid than Dickens, Austen still manages in this one, to portray everyone extremely well. Mr. Collins really is detestable, Bingley overly-cheerful and positive, and Darcy stiff and stern (though he has his reasons, of course.) Mrs. Bennet is an extremely foolish woman, as is Lydia, the youngest Bennet. The pride and prejudice of the story refer, I believe, to Mr. Darcy's pride and Elizabeth's prejudice (though it is certainly debatable.) Mr. Darcy is very proud indeed at the beginning of the story, and Elizabeth's prejudice prevents her from seeing his true character for a while.I will just add that I read the Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition from 2009, and while it has a very nice design, it does not have any analysis or introduction, so if you want that you'd be better off reading the Penguin Classics regular edition or Oxford World Classics. However, my Penguin Classics Deluxe edition arrived slightly damaged on the spine, which was a disappointment.[...]	5
Can you imagine a more classic tale of romance?You are immediately transported back to the 19th century--I want tobring this book with me every time I travel to the English countryside.More than any other novel, this story really captures Austen's wit.Books these days are so lackluster in comparison, and it's becomeso incredibly hard to find a hero to live up to Darcy. I'm never, everbored when I pick this up--even on the hundredth read!PLEASE give this one a shot if you haven't already--you won't be sorry!	5
Blame Jane - Austen that is - for The Marriage Plot: the idea that a woman's ambition and happiness rests solely upon marriage to a man; and that she is free to use any means to land her man, including to a great degree: gossip, deceit, and deception. In addition, she need not worry that he is not the ideal man, for she can mold him into what it is she wants because he is witless--putty in her hands. Unless he is a scoundrel, who turns the plot upside down on an unsuspecting nubile. Cheers, Mr. Wickham.Nora Roberts owes Austen for her fortune and success. Austen was the pioneer that many other romance writers have followed. Not only writers, but including real girls and women for, apparently, centuries, right on up to today; and is responsible for much of marriage's misery (sometimes for some people.) For some, I know, The Marriage Plot works.Jane Austen was a young, little (Actually, I don't know if she was little or what she looked like - but I do know she had one fine imagination.) twerp--writing wishful fantasies in her attic about things she had little experience with, having never been married, or `properly in love,' or, "`violently in love."' Thank goodness she didn't write sex scenes.Oh Miss Bennet, no not you Jane, or you Mary, or her niece, or the other sister, or her cousin, or his cousin - yes, you Elizabeth, the creature that is Mr. Bennet's daughter, or should I call you Lizzy? Eliza? The writing is often confusing and redundant and nothing happens but gossip and sideways conversations - which is probably accurate for the times. It certainly is today. So there is that. If Austen were alive today she might be a stand-up comic. She's funny, and if you can muddle through the bad writing - amusing and entertaining. I struggled to finish the book, but then I'm not a fan of The Marriage Plot nor bad writing. Nevertheless - five stars because she was way ahead of her time - a true pioneer.	5
I LOVE the movie so I decided to finally read the book. It's great! Beautifully written. I downloaded it to my kindle. It has quickly become a favorite of mine.	5
What sets this work apart from many others is that the story is so well focused that one does not lose track of any of the main characters. Really, there is no need for sequels because all the loose ends are tied up. For that reason, Austen has given us a remarkable masterpiece.I will not go into the plot, you need to read it, but just know that this book is at one time a fanciful and a serious examination of the lives of women in the neoclassical era.	5
Pride and Prejudice was one of the remaining Austen novels I have not read (Northanger Abbey is the other one). Emma, Mansfield Park, Sense and Sensibility, Persuasion...loved them all. So I figured it was about time I pick this one up off my shelf.Boy, I was not disappointed! It almost felt like coming back to an old friend, even though I have never read P&P; before. But I know the story very well, having fallen in love with the BBC series. And I loved it. I loved it so much that I don't know what to say. It is that good. And it is jumping right up to the top of my all-time favorite lists.It's witty - I love the early banter between Mr Darcy and Elizabeth when Jane is recovering from an illness at Mr Bingley's home. It's funny - Mr Collins just cracks me up, and you just have to laugh at Mrs Bennett's scheming. Almost 200 years later, it is still a page turner. And as much as I love reading classics, I would not describe most of them as a page turner!It is also a comfort book. I can't help but love almost all of the characters, despite their flaws. Immersing yourself in the novel is like having a cup of tea with an old friend. It's a joy to read, and I am positive that over the years I will be reading it again...and again...and again.	5
This book was so interesting! I sat reading and could hardly put it down. It has great suspense which I truly enjoyed. I am a romantic and anything that ends in true love is great. However most of the language (old English) can be challenging to read initially but you eventually get used to it.	5
This was an unexpected read for me. I honestly would recommend this book to others looking for a nice read.	5
I recommend this book for all to read if you are a romanticist. This book is about chivalry, friendship, total loyalty among sisters and most of all true love over coming obstacles of power and money. I love the part when she is confronted by the Aunt and all her responses. She is sharp to the point and remains a Lady.	5
I enjoyed this e-book very much because I have seen versions of the film and TV presentations and reading the book gives a more indepth study of the writing style of Jane Austen. The film and TV presentations couldn't include everything in the book such as a study of each main character. You must read the book slowly to enjoy her usage of words or you will miss the message because there are so many words to describe an event, person, scene, experience, etc. This book is very similar to a Harry Potter book - you need to read it more than once to capture the little things lead to something bigger. She gets you involved with her characters and you feel for them and you might even cry with them.	5
If you were a proper English mother at the time of Jane Austen, what sort of novel would you want your impressionable young daughter to read? You certainly wouldn't want her reading romance novels, for that might result in her eloping with the gamekeeper! No, you would want her to read a sensible novel, about how it is important to marry money, and that upper class men, even if they seem haughty, are really the best husbands. You would want her to read novels that reinforce, rather than undermine, the class-ridden social fabric. You would want her to read novels that show that even less-than-beautiful girls can use their wits to snare husbands far wealthier than themselves. In other words, you would want her to read Pride and Prejudice, the ideal anti-romantic novel.The novel offers a stark contrast between sisters. The younger sister falls in love with a poor army officer, and, by following her heart, brings herself and the family to the brink of disgrace. The heroine, by contrast, by keeping her head, marries the haughty but wealthy man, saves the family, and climbs up a notch or two in social caste. The men in the novel are neatly arranged according to wealth: the best men are Darcy and his rich friends; in the middle is the father, a nice but ineffectual character; at the base is the poor and caddish army officer. Things appear differently early in the novel, when the army man appears dashing and noble, and Darcy seems rude and prejudiced. But by the end, the rightness of the class system is revealed, and the heroine discovers that marrying wealth is the best way after all.This is the perfect instructional tale for cynics of Austen's time, and for ours. Enjoy this masterpiece of anti-romantic fiction.	3
This is a wonderful classic of English literature. Besides, it is a really good novel not only about love, it is also a criticism about an English age.	5
It's one of the first books I've read in English. I've read it many times after in English and Polish and I never get bored with it. I absolutely love it. For the language, storyline, heroine.	5
I can read it over and over again and never get bored of it! Highly recommended to start off if you're new to Jane Austen's books!	5
More detailed than movie. I liked this book because it gives you an idea of what it was like in that time.	4
I like this book in my library because I get a chance to get back to a time that I would have wish that I was never part of.	4
This book was really good I highly recommended it .It's a little more advance for children under 13 enjoy iy	5
Pride & Prejudice is one of the few books that I can honestly say earned its status as a classic with a huge fan base. It is brilliantly written plot-wise and character-wise, set in the time of propriety and manners in Regency England (early 1800s). Jane Austen at her bestSynopsis: (WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!!!)The novel opens with the arrival of a wealthy young gentleman, Mr. Charles Bingley, at Netherfield Park, accompanied by his rather haughty sisters and friend, Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. Seeing the wealthy newcomers, the Bennet family of the nearby village of Longbourn, is in great excitement. The silly and impractical Mrs. Bennet thereupon aims to marry off at least one of her five daughters: Jane (the eldest and the kindest), Elizabeth (the most sensible), Mary (the most studious), Kitty (the simple-minded), and Lydia (the silliest). Almost immediately, the amiable Mr. Bingley is well-liked by the community, while his friend, Mr. Darcy, appears just the opposite. From the start, since he rejected her at a ball, Elizabeth's first impression of Mr. Darcy is to be arrogant, proud, and conceited. Her dislike of him is only heightened when she hears an account of Mr. Darcy, as ruthless and cold-hearted, from a handsome and sociable young officer, Mr. George Wickham. Meanwhile, despite Mrs. Bennet's embarrassing meddling, Mr. Bingley and Jane Bennet begin to develop an attachment, and though unawares, Elizabeth's liveliness and intelligence grows on Mr. Darcy, who unconsciously falls for her - despite all his objections to her inferior birth status and her ridiculous mother and younger sisters. As Elizabeth, the main protagonist, eventually discovers, one of her two admirers - Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy - has all the appearance of goodness, while the other has all the genuine goodness.	5
The content of this book receives five stars with ease. This version gets two at best. There are countless errors in spelling and grammar, which annoys me greatly. Despite this, I found this novel to be a delightful read. I haven't enjoyed a book like this in ages.	5
I have the story mostly memorized from reading the book and watching the movies, and the narrator does a good job of changing up the voices and carrying the emotion of the story. It did take a little while to get used to her voice, but I am enjoying the tale. You can never go wrong with Jane Austen. She is funny, witty and has a keen eye into human nature. Enjoy!	5
im not a native english speaker..and i found the writing very tender very subtle and funny i just loved to read some antique english without all the idioms that are used nowadays..i can see why austen is still a very preferred reading at all ages!	5
I read it for the first time when I was 16, and I've read it at least once every year since... I never get tired of reading this book. Elizabeth Bennett has taught me to never settle when it comes to matters of the heart. I always find that the middle of the book drags a bit, as I'm not interested on the drama concerning Jane, but Lizzie & Darcy will always bring me back.	5
I'll keep it short since it's probably all been said before. But how Ms. Austen can create such dramatic page-turning tension with so little real "action" is beyond me.	5
This was by far, most certainly, without a doubt.. the first book I put on my Kindle over two years ago. And I can't count the number of times I've read it since then! Jane Austen is a wonderful writer... Lizzy is an amazing character to follow and fall in love with. Mr. Darcy... so dark and mysterious and stern. I love reading about the social and societal customs and ideals... it's so very interesting, so different from life today. No matter what mood I'm in, I can flip to Pride and Prejudice and feel warm, cozy, and content within minutes. Favorite book of all time. Weeeell.. Pride and Prejudice is in direct competition with Harry Potter.. for the spot of 'favorite book of all time.' But it's definitely right up there. You can't go wrong - read this book!!	5
This classic by Jane Austen was amazing. I am only eleven years old and I completely fell in love with this book. After reading it, my friend read it too, and she LOVED it! This is one those timeless books...It takes place in Regency England. Elizabeth Bennet meets Mr. Darcy at a party. At first, she thinks he is prideful and prejudiced. But after knowing him, they kinda fall in love...I am doing a book cube project on this book, and this book is completly AMAZING!!!	5
A mother's driving force is getting her five daughters married quickly; it hardly matters to whom. A suitor proposes, is summarily rejected and marries someone else within days. A woman doesn't like men but wants to get married anyway. A sixteen-year-old runs off with a man and doesn't marry him right away, much to the dismay of both her parents and sisters. A mother has no use for her daughter's suitor but happily accepts him into the family because he is rich. The less money a family has, the more important it is that all their daughters marry and quickly. If the family lives in the country, they must work harder to get these daughters married. Sound like your favorite sitcom and/or your favorite cousin and her family? Well, it's Jane Austin's timeless PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Here we have much ado about getting the daughters married.Everybody points out what is so unique about this novel as well as the rest of Austin's works. She does very little to place them in any given time. They are good because of what they don't tell us. Austin doesn't give us a lot of specificity about a lot of things. For example, The Bennetts are always entertaining yet we don't know much about what they eat other than "venison" or "meat." Wickham may wear a blue coat when he gets married. The young women often play music but we are never told the names of the pieces they play.The ironic first line of the novel is well-known: "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife." With that great opener, we are off to the races.Parts of this novel will make you smile; others will make your laugh. My favorite character is the father, Mr. Bennett, who is quick to see and point out his wife's and others' foibles but never sees his own. Somehow it seemed Jane Austen anticipated the future when much of her character's behavior would be seen as folly, though we certainly have follies of our own today.	5
Jane Austen's works are always engaging, entertaining, heart-warming, and funny. So well written and so much more true romance than any dime store novel ever could attain to be. The only downside is that this copy seems to have some glitch where it will double a sentence and place that 2nd sentence a few paragraphs later but it's in a way that it's obvious it doesn't belong there. The only thing I could figure was that in the hard copy there is some book print style picture with a quote from the book under it as would be typical in many books of this type and that in the kindle version it just doesn't show the picture.	5
Jane Austen is the queen of female writers. Her prose is timeless. Her heroine is feisty,gutsey,witty, and unwilling to compromise. Her hero is often misunderstood. Her outcome is delightful.She has not been surpassed in 200 years.	5
This book has been my favorite since the first time I read it. I try to read it once a year and dream of someday having my own Mr Darcy!	5
I'm like the details. The word neighborhood was spelled wrong. I'm liked the end.of the story where she said they deserved	5
This book is a classic, and it is not by accident. Austen's way of writing is fine and poetic, and each characters are very realistic. The famous love story has a precious lesson behind it, and it makes you reflect about yourself and your relations with others.	4
An out-of-this world experience, especially for the missus who had studied the hard copy at school in her teens. Today is the 200th anniversary to the day of this novel first being published in the UK, so this review comes with all the stars it duly deserves. Congratulations for making it possible with modern technology.	5
i love Jane Austen, and this is just the perfect romance, i keep re-reading it to cheer me up when i'm blu	5
Jane Austen makes a great chronicle of life. The way country people behaved and their thoughts. Just a wonderful and timeless book.	5
It doesn't matter how many times I've read this, I love coming home to the beauty and creativity of this classic tale.	5
What a great book. I read it on my phone and had it finished in days. This was a great &#34;just for fun&#34; book to read.	5
There have been at least 3 movies made from this novel, but none will tell the story quite like the book. This is a classic romance that can be enjoyed at any age. I've read this novel at least 3 times over the years.	5
Thank a lot for your goods. Sorry for delay in your answer.Ricardo Drab------------------ -------- ---- --- --- ---	5
One of my favorites. This book is a classic and I highly recommend it! Don't be discouraged by the style.	5
"Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how."First read. Very enjoyable. Loved Mr. Collins. Bravisimi. Oy, vey!	5
As is probably expected, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this enduring classic. I have long admired Jane Austin's careful understanding of affection and love. It is a wonderful book to recommend	5
Prior to reading Pride and Prejudice, I had just completed reading Emma. I was so bored by the tedious nature of Emma that I couldn't see what the inspiration was of such a following as portrayed in the movie "The Jane Austin Book Club" which I thoroughly enjoyed and was inspired to read some of her works. I prevailed and went on to read another of her books, Pride and Prejudice. I am pleased to say that I'm hooked and am looking forward to reading another of her works. (I still feel that Emma was very tedious and boring though)	5
It's okay!!!!!!!!fine to me not the best in the world but it's okay I'm fine with it it's okay thanks	3
I was surprised in myself that I had never read such a good classic. I have seen the movir, etc, but that never compares with reading the book.. I am so glad I read it.	5
Jane Austen cannot but become a favorite after reading Pride and Prejudice. It may have taken 36 years to get to it, but I couldn't devour it fast enough once began. I was amazed at how easily the personalities were painted in Elizabeth's language of each man. You can't help but know each man exactly for who he is as Elizabeth does, not always timely but eventually the truth comes out. Splendid storytelling. Exceptional literature!	5
I had to get this e-book to read for an academic compisition test. Convinient because it was free. Plus a good read.	5
I loved the book so much. It is such an easier read than I thought it to be. I was greatly entertained.	5
Others may vote for EMMA, but the story of Elizabeth Bennett and FitzWilliam Darcy's stormy romance has been read, dramatized, and filmed more times for the delectation of more readers. Enjoyed by teens through centenarians for two centuries, this comedy of manners belongs in every collection. A true comfort read--and a delight!	5
Classic Book! Great to have it on my Kindle and ready to read whenever I want. If you haven't read this novel yet, you're missing out!	5
What a fantastic book which was brought to life by the BBC series starring Colin Firth. Now I can hear them talking and I just love this book. I can visualize my English ancestors in the village.	5
I loved the plot. However, since this is an old book, the plot was alittle confusing. One of the best love stories of all time.	4
easy to read catches ur interest quickly good first experience for kindle will reread and look for sequels thank you	3
I purchased this for my son's college freshman English class; it arrived promptly ; he read it from cover to cover; and received an &#34;A&#34;.	5
To read Jane Austen's articulation of the English language is an experience. This book reveals a good picture of English country living among the genteel. It is humorous with a touch of seriousness. I had previously read this book but as with all good classics, it is worth reading again. Kindle books are the way to go. So accessible and convenient.	5
Must admit that I only read it so that I can say that it is done. I found this a bit slow. All character development and gossip and very little action. Some people love it, just not me. Side note: I read it using the kindle app on my iPad and didn't have any of the problems mentioned with font size and spacing that some others mentioned.	3
Quite an interesting book if you can understand the language and wordiness of the time. I found Jane Austin's ability to show how pride and presumption can affect our lives very valuable.	4
A classic that stands the test of time, and gets better with every read! I never grow tired of reading Elizabeth and Darcy's story.	5
I always resisted reading this book. I thought that the old, female bounding type society was something I never wanted to relive. However, I came to truly love Elizabeth.This was another 'home book club' pick of my daughters and I, and we also enjoyed it. We loved the language, which is so well spoken and hilarious (Elizabeth). She has a way of verbalizing positive demoralization, which makes others walk away with their tails between their legs!We also loved many of the other characters, such as Lydia, and the idiot Bennets.Now to why we only gave 4 stars. The Kindle version I have is FULL of errors! Also, one of our books had a HORRIBLE font, and was missing many of the illustrations that were in our other two books. I had to go to the library to get a copy for our reading group.	4
In thirty years of reading, I somehow missed reading this book (or anything by Austen). If I hadn't been trying to fill my new Kindle with free books, I don't know if I ever would have read it. There were too many movie adaptations that held zero interest for me and too many rip-offs from authors unable to imagine their own characters and wanting to pick up where Austen had left off. I didn't think that this book would have anything for me. I was too cool for Jane Austen.I was wrong. Austen is amazingly witty and the romance of Elizabeth and Darcy is one of the sweetest and realistically character-driven I've ever read. Despite the setting, the two of them are so well-imagined as to achieve a kind of timelessness. I highly recommend this book, especially if you've never read Austen before.As far as Kindle editions go, this isn't one of the best. There are some weird line breaks. The typos and repeated words mentioned in earlier reviews seem to be fixed, but any word with emphasis in the original is all caps in this edition -- it's a bit like reading an over-heated chat room discussion at first, but I got used to it.	5
Pride and Prejudice is one of the greatest novels in English literature and is truly deserving of being called a classic. First published in 1813, it is set at the turn of the 19th century in a fictional town near London. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are blessed with five daughters, ranging in age from 15 to 22. The novel opens with Mrs. Bennet anxiously thinking about how to marry her daughters off, as that was the primary way for women to achieve financial security during those times. The story is told in third person from the point of view of the second eldest daughter Elizabeth Bennet.Of the four Jane Austen novels that I've read, Pride and Prejudice is my favorite. This is not because I didn't enjoy the others, I most certainly did, but rather because Pride and Prejudice affected me on so many different levels. It touched my heart and swept me away, as I absolutely fell in love with Mr. Darcy. It also provoked my mind, as I reflected upon the many issues that Austen explores in this novel. It is a subtle book, as all Jane Austen novels are, and that is its beauty. All of the issues that Jane Austen raises in this book slowly simmer in your mind.One of the reasons I love Pride and Prejudice is that it is a romance for those with a bit of a feminist streak. Elizabeth Bennet is a strong character who isn't afraid to speak her mind. She is no weak wallflower. Many romantic plots feature a damsel in distress who is saved by her knight in shining armor. That is most definitely not the case here. The love story in Pride and Prejudice shows that you can have chivalrous man and grand romantic gestures without a weak heroine.I also love Pride and Prejudice for Austen's excellent treatment of the characters. Both of the main characters, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, grow, develop, and change throughout the novel. Their character developments are deep, thorough, and convincing. In contrast, the supporting characters do not change much. Their constancy provides a nice point of comparison to the growth of the main characters.The novel is a full-fledged social commentary on marriage, love, money, wealth, social class, propriety, as well as pride and prejudice. It is fascinating to learn how different those times were from today, especially in the lack of opportunity for women; and yet, it is even more fascinating to think about how relevant the issues are to today. The more things change, the more they seem to stay the same.If you only read one Jane Austen novel, let it be Pride and Prejudice. Be patient with the old English language. It is not an easy read, but it is worth your while.	5
Vapid and pompous! Despite the clever rhetoric, the plot and characters are simply too shallow, predictable and archetypical. Yes, this novel is a classic, and an original of the romance genre, but that doesn't make up for the fact that it, in fact, is romance genre: WAY to simplistic.Couldn't stand the book, not when I read it at 20 and not when I gave it another chance at 49. Disappointing because I loved the movie "Sense and Sensibility" (with Kate Winslet, Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman), so I thought I would like the author.And yes, I do love Dickens. Despite her myriad adoring fans, in my opinion, Jane Austen's writing lacks depth and cannot truly be compared to Dickens.	2
This was a required book in high school English. Thank God for Cliff Notes, because this is the book that taught thousands of young men to hate reading.This summer, I forced my way through the book, because I wanted to understand what was so great about it. I discovered it was GREAT to finish the book. Don't give this book to a kid to encourage reading.This book was clearly written for a different time. Chapter upon chapter of utter tedium conveying precious little to the course of the story. However, in that tedium was character development worthy of study by would be writers. Maybe that's why we were supposed to read it.	3
I love this book so much! Elizabeth Bennett is a feminist hero. She doesn't go all crazy trying to land a hubby as her sisters do. She scoffs at the &Uuml;ber sexy Darcy. Poor Jane suffers when Bingley and his evil ho sisters skip town. Lydia and Kitty "service" sailors and the former ends up marrying a deadbeat loser. Mrs. Bennett is comparable to Kris Kardashian, as she is obsessed with getting all of her daughters married off. A great book, a true classic!	5
I couldn't resist writing a review for one of my favorite books of all time! I admit the language is a little hard to get used to at first, but once you get in a rhythm, it's fabulous. The romance is classic and probably forms the basis for a lot of the modern romances today. The hate you / love you interaction between Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy is captivating. This is one of the few books I love to read over and over.	5
this book is pretty incredible book but a bit long! Jane Austen's characters like Elizabeth Bennett, Mr. Darcy, and the bad lady Miss Bingley Jane all add to this complicated plot. Elizabeth Bennett is very well shown character, maybe the best ever written This novel is an excellent example of Austen's literary power. Her ladies are to be admired for they marry for love not the social reasons. There is a lot of pressure in society to marry in your social class but love should be the main reason. Maybe the reason it seems a bit long is there are many characters, it is difficult to keep up with them all. Pride and Prejudice has to be read at least twice to catch everything and everybody. But it is an enjoyable read.	5
Remembered reading this in high school and not fully understanding a lot of the complex issues raised in this book. It's nice to have another read at an older age to appreciate the author's words, and have a better understanding of what makes this such a classic book.	5
I decided to reread this classic because I wanted to read PD James' new novel which continues the story of Darcy and Elizabeth after their marriage when there is a murder. I wondered if I would enjoy this book after reading it some decades ago and seeing at least one movie version of it. To my delight, I found the rereading fun. The statement that a classic is a classic because people enjoy reading it is true. The book is filled with humor and witty social comments. Jane Austen pocks fun at the generally uneducated women of her age, their silliness, their interest in looking beautiful, men, marriage, and family, the strong difference between them and the men in their lives, and how some very intelligent women, such as Elizabeth Bennet, stand out despite not being as beautiful as her sisters, and accomplishing more than them. This was a time when a woman walking three miles was unusual and women reading non-fiction was extraordinary.The story focuses on Elizabeth and on Darcy's pride. He is very good looking, rich, more intelligent than most of the people he encounters, and sees their foolish behavior and thoughts as a waste of time and absurd. His first impression of Elizabeth is negative. Looking only at her surface, he sees a young woman who is not as beautiful as others at a party. As a result, he makes a remark that Elizabeth overhears, that disparages her. Later, he sees the beauty of her character and intelligence. But Elizabeth has become blind to his worth because of the prejudice created by his remark, and she avoids him. The story becomes even more interesting when other characters are introduced and we read about the five Bennet girls and their parents' reactions to them. Some seem good or bad at first, but are they, and why do they seem like they do?	5
I finally read P&P; at the insistence of a very good friend...we disagreed on the merits of the recent Keira Knightley P&P; film (I liked it; she didn't)...she challenged me to read the book so that i would understand, and now I do!The goal of all the great novels, the experts tell us, is to arrive at some fundamental TRUTH.The genius of Jane Austen was that she told us the truth from the get go: "that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife." and the MORE important truth: "However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters."And by declaring the truth from the get go, she brilliantly illuminates it throughout.This is a book for EVERYONE:For fathers (like me!), who love all their children, but recognize each for their faults and good parts...delights in the marriage of their daughters if they will be happy (like I am going through now)...the most touching part for me was how much Mr. Bennet loved Elizabeth and Jane and missed Elizabeth so much when she was gone.For children, especially, teens who are MORTIFIED at the behaviour of their parents in front of their friends. I mean, could Mrs. Bennet BE more embarrassing?!For brothers and sisters, to see the beauty and challenge of being siblings, especially in a large family!But, especially, for people who are - as Jane Austen put it - *violently* in love. She expressed it so well in the almost manic internal ponderings of Elizabeth and even Darcy, and and all at once: I hate him/her, I love him/her, I hope he/she will see me, I hope he/she doesn't come, how could he be so uncivil, how could he/she be so kind, I think he/she loves me, he/she could never love me...and also the joy of being friends before being lovers.I loved how she portrayed Mr Collins only in terms of his ridiculous language and habits; the filmmakers "cheated" by making Collins short to be ridiculous and then piled on; Austen saw the comedy not in his stature but in his silliness.I also loved the emphasis on letter writing to pour out ones fears and feelings...it is a lost art and we are the worse for it.The only thing I didn't like, and will likely never appreciate, is a culture where people don't have to show up at work everyday...I just don't get it...I guess that's why I enjoy historical fiction of common folks of the 18th and 19th century (by Matthew Pearl, Louis Bayard, David Liss, and others), where even the elite have to actually *do* something.I thanks my friend and Miss Austen for helping me appreciate a true classic!	5
"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long age. I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun."This sentence is from the novel Pride and Prejudice, the most famous book written by Jane Austen. The author set the background as conservative and traditional British countryside life which still pay attention to the reputation and have their own social circle. It contrasts with the people who are upper- class. They are selfish and prideful. Through five middle class girls how to choose love shows the values of marriage in that time, in that society. But among them there still exists people like Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley who finally choose their true love. And the sentence expresses the true love in a class structure society is really cherished between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. It fully shows Mr. Darcy's love to Elizabeth.For a long time, because of Mr. Darcy's pride, he hides his love to Elizabeth. It leads to Elizabeth has a misunderstanding to Mr. Darcy since the first time they meet. As the most important themes in this novel, love plays a special role in this book. The whole story develops around the different barriers in the true love and how people to respond these difficulties. And all of these difficulties come from one reason that is the social force. The social structure makes Mr. Darcy's pride that he feels like he should be proud of himself. Because he is richer than others and live in the upper- class. At the same time, it also the social structure makes Elizabeth's prejudice. She knows she and her family is just in a middle- class. So she is more sensitive than others and she does not want others such as Mr. Darcy looks down upon her. But just because of her sensitive, it makes her different from other girls. Elizabeth is the most intelligent girl in her family. She is clever and high- hearted. When she first meets Mr. Darcy, she has a really poor impression about him. Mr. Darcy is a wealthy and intelligent gentleman, so faces Elizabeth's prejudice; he chooses to be silent and does not explain anything. When he proposes to Elizabeth, Elizabeth determined rejects him and mentions Wickham's deceit. But Mr. Darcy still says nothing about it, the only thing he says is "I don't want to talk about it at all." This is just one obstacle between them. Before they realize their sincerely love to each other, they have faced the different troubles and numerous stumbling blocks- Miss Bingley's snobbery, Lady Catherine's attempt to control her nephew, Mrs. Bennet's idiocy and Wickham's lies. All of these obstacles make a big difficulty exist in their love. Especially, the class- structure and reputation is more serious. The class- structure is really significant in that society. There are so many differences between them. They have the totally different life style since they were born. So from the origin of their mind is different. In the beginning, Mr. Darcy's pride to the people who live in the countryside hurts Elizabeth a lot. He thinks as girl as Elizabeth should be happy that he loves. Therefore, in the first time he says courtship to Elizabethj, he thinks she would love to say "yes." But he gets an unexpected answer. And finally he knows Elizabeth in the only woman who loves him, not his money. So he helps Elizabeth's sister Lydia and Wickham, who is a fortune- hunting officer. And he explains all things through the letter from Elizabeth's aunt. He earned his love back. That proves love is a force that can be separated from social structure and facts and it shows love can conquer anything even the hardest thing- people's mind.Reputation is another theme in the novel; it helps to strengthen the difficulty between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. For Elizabeth, reputation is not that important for middle class girl. She prefers to live with her family than cares about the reputation. So when she knows her sister Jane is ill, she walks to Netherfiled alone. She arrives with muddy skirt, to the shock of reputation- conscious Mass Bingley and her friends. She does not care how people judge her. In Miss Bingley's eyes, her behavior is absolute not acceptable in the upper- class. From Miss Bingley's reaction, it expresses Elizabeth's unique and her natural personality. But when sister elopes with Wickham and lives with him out of wedlock, the reputation- conscious happened again. Bennet family is not invited to the ball anymore, and even they walk as they run. Whatever Elizabeth does not care her reputation, but her family cannot avoid it. The social force still exists in her life. She cannot escape from it. But in her most difficult time, Elizabeth finds Mr. Darcy is the only person that wants to help her to find her sister back, give her sister money and solved all problems for them. She suddenly realizes she is wrong about her prejudice. So she decides to accept Mr. Darcy's courtship. They break the social structure and rules and finally get married.This novel reflects how people treat marriage in that society. People only pursue wealth and reputation. Girls can marry with a guy such as Mr. Collins, only for his money. Parents pay attention to the man who their daughter will marry is rich, not whether their daughter really loves him. They pursue social position instead of love. But just because of that, it shows the true love between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth is special and cherished. The author in this novel also tries to tell people, in this world we need to change, change can solve anything.	5
One friend asked me why the book, Pride and Prejudice, became one of the most famous classics of all time. She knew it exemplified a great English writing style, but after reading the book, it only gave her the impression of an early 19th century "chick-flick", targeted for fans of romance novels. The book, however, offered me not only a witty, romantic comedy but also educational and historical values through the realistic depictions of an early 19th century English society.Throughout the whole book, the main characters constantly reminded me of the famous maxim: Don't judge a book by its cover. When the heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, meets the male character, Darcy, she finds him handsome, young and rich; the type of men that any women during her time period would consider to be the perfect husband. But his proud arrogance and aloofness prick her pride, causing her to stubbornly decide to dislike Darcy. This fire of hatred is further fueled along when Wickham, a handsome soldier, wins Liz's heart through his seemingly agreeable personality. Providing her with spiteful lies about Darcy, Wickham helps Liz's prejudice to grow. When the truth is reveled, however, Liz realizes that she had made the wrong impressions about both Darcy and Wickham based upon their exterior behaviors and appearances. In fact, Wickham turns out to be a scandalous liar whose addiction for gambling has broke him poor and Darcy turns out to be a truly noble person who knows how to care for and love those dear to him.In the end, Liz learns to correct her mistake of making misimpression and eventually marries Darcy who loves her for who she really is. This unrealistically happy ending, however, caused me to be aware of the real matrimony system in the early 19th century. The main characters ended happily; a girl from a poor family married the perfect man from a wealthy background due to their true, inseparable love. But other characters showed otherwise. For example, Liz's friend, Charlotte Lucas, agreed to marry Mr. Collins despite the fact that her friend had rejected him a few days ago. No love existed in this marriage obviously, but Charlotte could not have been happier as the marriage had much benefit for her: it saved her from her poor financial status and even from the shame of remaining unmarried at her old age. Just like Charlotte, many lower class women settled to be content with marriages, if they brought them or their families a little benefit.On the other hand, Ms. Bingley and Lady Catherine show how the upper class of the early 19th century married. Ignoring love mostly, both compared Darcy's social class, financial status, and family background to judge if marrying herself (Ms. Bingley's case) or her daughter (Lady Catherine's case) would be the most advantageous combination. In both cases, the source of wealth and power could be traced as the men, whom the women had to depend on and negotiate with to marry as best as they could. Both classes considered greatly the effects on the future and the family that the marriage would bring and the way how these female character perceived marriages proved how the real women during the early 19th century actually married.In conclusion, Pride and Prejudice should not be only read for observing Jane Austen's talent in writing or for mere enjoyment of romantic comedy, but also for development in mature perception and the cultural history that the book offered. Pride and Prejudice is an educational novel that clearly depicts the difficulty in forming perspective about other people and the dangers that could arise when our impressions or senses are trusted too much. It does not only offer an insight into how women of the early 19th century really lived but shows their lifestyle, way of thinking and the harsh reality of the matrimony system.	5
I've read this book a million times. That is, I've read the library's book as well as an old 80's edition that had pages ripped out and taped back together. I ordered this copy as a special gift to me to celebrate my favorite author. This edition is beautiful and well worth the buy. While being a new edition, it has the feel of an older one.	5
I took me years to read this book! It started when I was 12 years old, a friend of my moms gave me the A&E; version on VHS tape, you know, the one with Colin Firth!!! After watching all 6 hours of that for day's in a row, i found it hard to sit down and read the book?But then I got my Kindle, and this was one of the first book I read! It was great to have the details filled in that the movie left out, and also to have the image of Colin Firth in my head as Mr. Darcy! I love this book and the A&E; version of it! : I am now 26 years old, so it took me about 14 years for me to finally read the book, but it was well worth it. I now also own the movie on DVD!! ;)	5
The Bennet sisters Elizabeth and Jane are of age to court and find a spouse. Elizabeth find one person in particular that she will never court, Fitzwilliam Darcy, or will his charming ways find their way into her heart.This book is suppose to be humorous. I did not find anything funny or remotely interesting, well until Darcy came along. In all truthness I can not see how this book has gotten so many other books based on the characters of Darcy and Elizabeth. I don't get it. I wish I did. I wanted to like this so much more than I did. All I could see the book is about is dancing and gossip. It reminds me of a older version of Seinfeld because it was about nothing. I did not give diddly squat about anybody in this book. Yes it is written pretty and well done but I had no connection to the people.You are probably wondering why I would give any stars if I dislike it so much but the truth is certain moments caught my attention and as I said it is written pretty. I only thought it to be okay maybe a little less than that.	3
Not my type of book. I read it all tho. But would not purchase it or a similiar one again.	1
I did not read the book. I want this book off my kindle. I am getting very angry. very angry.	1
i know she is supposed to be one of the classic greats, but i just can't get into her writing (i force myself because i feel that i should read the classics, if only to make me a well rounded reader). i found the book slow going and to be quite honest, boring.	3
In the book Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen the story circles around the whole idea of marriage, and reputation. Everyone in the novel wants to find love, and marry someone. Mrs. Bennet desperately wants her five daughters to find husbands and she makes it "The business of her life" (Austen, pg 5) to get her daughters married. Throughout the novel the characters must cope with the issues of pride and wealth in their community and in turn deal with the pressures of marrying into a good family.Mr. Bingley, who is a wealthy man, is very attracted to Jane, the eldest daughter. They dance at the ball and she believes that he is the right man for her. Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley's friend, does not want to dance with Elizabeth, Jane's sister, because she isn't part of the same social class as Mr. Darcy. This makes him seem very arrogant. However, as the novel progresses Mr. Darcy sets aside his prejudice, and actually starts to fall for Elizabeth. Elizabeth starts to realize that she actually has feelings for Mr. Darcy. She understands that she isn't as rich as Mr. Darcy, and that she does not come from the same world as him. Elizabeth looks past the arrogance she once saw in Mr. Darcy, and learns to love him regardless.Elizabeth's younger sister elopes with Officer Wickham, and the family is ashamed. Elizabeth fears that their pride may be ruined. Even though the two are happy together the family acts callously towards the couple because they do not think that Wickham is good enough for her, and she would be better off with someone from a high social class.Jane and Mr. Bingley get engaged and everyone is happy again. Lady Catherine tells Elizabeth about Mr. Darcy's intentions on marrying her, and that she should say no. Lady Catherine does not think that Elizabeth is worthy of her nephew because he is so wealthy, and she is just average. Elizabeth says that she isn't going to throw away her happiness, and accepts when Mr. Darcy proposes.The book was very well written but the plot was a little boring and goes back and forth too much. I felt that all anyone really cared about was whether or not they were going to get married. I thought that the way the characters spoke, and how the actual words were written were very eloquent, and made a simple phrase sound beautiful. I feel like what the author was saying could have been said in fewer words, and she could have condensed it into a shorter novel.I also liked how Elizabeth didn't give into Mr. Darcy right away and she stood her ground, yet Mr. Darcy did not give up on Elizabeth. She thought that he was very arrogant but then once she got to know him she actually appreciated him.Because the book focuses mainly on the subject of marriage, and love, only certain people may find enjoyment and entertainment in it. I don't believe that this novel was written for one specific age group, and could be read by many different ages. I think that young adults might enjoy the novel the best, because it deals with finding love. Again, the book was very well written, but a little too repetitive.	3
Miss Elisabeth Bennet is a very witty, ironically and independent woman. She is the opposite of Mr. Darcy. He embodies the modern, educated and pride person of the upper class. She is full of prejudices against his behaviour. It is a story of resentment and misunderstanding. The first impression of a person is a constant picture which you carry along with you. It takes time to get rid of it and so does Elisabeth. Jane Austen takes this picture to develop her story. The reader follows the view of Elisabeth in the whole story to the rear end. During the elopement of Elisabeth younger sister Lydia she realises that Mr. Darcy is not the kind of person she always thought of. Her change of mind takes place in the off. The reader is not familiar with it because Elisabeth rejects the love of Mr. Darcy every time. You feel astonished in the end when you hear what she reveals to Jane.The novel is characterised as a battle of words. There is no much description of the setting or the social class in the nineteenth century. It concentrates on the feelings and situations of the characters. Chatting all over, I think it is the typical pastime of every girl. The book is full of these situations. It is about love, envy, parties and what is hot in town.	3
I wanted so badly to love one the classic romances of all time, but couldn't. I found the story incredibly dated. I was able to get past the archaic use of vocabulary, but not the lack of plot. Most of this lengthy novel is about idle English gentry socializing at each others homes. I had nearly decided to give up on finishing the book, when it picked up a little in the final third. I read the free Kindle edition. While the formatting is not as good as with paid editions, it is perfectly adequate. I can't see any reason to get one of the paid versions, unless you are an Austen fan who wants the collected works organized with an active T.O.C.	2
Somehow never read Austen as a youngster but decided to read it on my new Kindle! I'm so glad I did! The story got off to a slow start, dull and dry! As I plowed on through a lot of dinners and dances some of the characters became appealing, the plot thickened. Suddenly I was hooked. I've become an Austen enthusiast I will be ordering more of her novels.	5
I was familiar with the BBC TV series which was beautifully produced. i read the book to see how it compared and it was excellent as the characters were exactly as expected. The authors use of english is very enjoyable and more accessible than I thought it would be. Best bit of 200 year old chicklit you can read.	5
I carry this in my car, in case I have to sit and &#34;wait&#34; for any reason.I have a good hardback in my bookcase at home.JAM	5
Have read this book many times and it always delights me one of her greatest works .Jane Austin will never go out of style	5
Having seen several versions of this story done in film, I wanted to know the original by the author, Jane Austen, so purchased this for my Kindle. I was pleased to see that most of the films did follow this book but also to read the details that are often left out of time-constrained movie productions. I've done this with several films that I liked and knew were based on books. As much as people seem to be in a digital world of films, books are still the best way to fully know a story.	5
I love everything about this book and highly recommend that every person read it! It is such a great read!	5
Starts off slow and it'd sure be pretty boring to be one of the characters in the book but this is an amazing book. Must read!	5
I could not finish this book before I watched the PBS mini series. Once I knew the characters it was a very easy read. Just too many facts for my brain. But it is the best book every. Great Love story.	5
This book was a good play of wit and romance, and I loved the juicy characters, such as Mr. and Mrs. Bennet. :) Would reccomend for advanced 13 year olds, but otherwise 14-15 and up.	5
Wonderful read! Ms. Austen's characters are so alive in her writing. Much to the chagrin of everyone around me, I couldn't put it down until it was done!	5
This is without question the worst book I've ever read in my entire life. The style is clumsy though the author strives to impress with an aristocratic pompousness so typical of social climbers of her day. The characters are cold, their development dull and boring and Austen's every attempt to portray the most basic of human relationships falls well short, getting completely tangled in ridiculously elite language that was in its day and remains still completely outdated. Commoners did not speak like that then, nor do they now. I would rather endure a daily root canal than read this book again. It was almost as inspirational as witnessing a mountain top removal to mine coal. It doesn't surprise me that her original manuscript was rejected as it should have been and now I wonder to what extent politics played a role in her eventual success? Perhaps zero of five stars would be more accurate...	1
I am not satisfied with the book`s cover image. I would have greatly prefered to have the movie image as a cover, since I greatly appreciated the movie, and since we are in the 21 century, were we do not have this kind of image. I would have bought the book if the movie image was featured on it.	1
Enjoyed this more thoroughly than expected. This is a story about the potential damage or fortune derived from preconceived societal notions. This is a story about standing up to social conventions in an age where such a concept was unthinkable, not to mention before its time. Taken slowly, poetically and whimsically, the human drama in this book is deeply touching, and can be appreciated by every culture on the globe.There are 5thousand reviews here, so I won't go into further detail, but rest assured, it's a CLASSIC and it's worth a read.	5
I was a little intimidated at first when I began this book, afraid I wouldn't be able to understand the old English language and terms. But it was easy to read and such a welcome change from all the empty, shallow writings of today. I wish I hadn't waited so long to read it!	5
I like Pride and Prejudice, so naturally I'll rate this edition highly. I like the story, and I like learning about that time period too.	5
The best characters, lessons, and humor. I'm always inspired by the upright character of the times, and the knowledge of human nature Austen displays is intriguing.	5
Wow is this book boring. Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen was PAINFUL to read.PAINFUL!!!!!The book is filled with rich people being super proper. Oh my goodness it was bad.Although a little more than halfway through the book, I did start to enjoy it. Mainly because they stopped being so stuffy and started being a little more real.There were a bunch of funny, underhanded proper comments, similar to something like "Why, doesn't she look pretty today?" but really meaning that she's super ugly and happens to have made herself look good for this moment.The overall story line: Daughters find people to become their husbands.Done.I just couldn't handle it.But it's a classic and I already know some of you are going to agree with me while others are like shouting at the screen in frustration at my review.So tell me your thoughts on Pride and Prejudice!Thanks for reading,Rebecca @ Love at First Book	2
Brilliant writing. What a use of the English language. So rich and complex. It takes a while to get into her writing stylewhich is so sophisticated and witty.Besides her use of the language which makes &#34;american English&#34; so much more pitiful, it is incredible how she weavesa fascinating tale, page after page, on the basis of a very simple story: i.e. boy meets girl.One is constantly in suspense and the level of eroticism is so high without even a hint of touch between the twoprotagonists for more than half the book.	5
All I had hoped for and then some!!! Having watched the movie in its various forms numerous times, I had wanted to read the book for years. I finally did, and am so glad!!	5
As good as I remembered it always being. Loved that I was able to read it for free. Definitely recommend it	5
A true classic for any Jane Austin fan. Kindle version was very nice to read through. As much as I love paperback go ahead and use the kindle version.	5
Even though there were more than a few times I had to look up some word that I didn't know. I found this book to be very good	3
I have started reading the list of 100 books to read before you die and this is my favorite so far. A beautiful story well written.	5
.it was a freebie. it was a paperless book. why not take advantage of it right? not like WHOA! book!	3
It's important to remember that Pride and Prejudice takes place during the later reign of George the Third at the beginning of the 19th century. The period was one of war and revolution that severely threatened upper class privileges. Conscription at home and reports of endless damger can never be comfortable news from across the channel and on the seas of the world. There was also the threat of invasion that Napoleon planned but was ultimately unable to execute. Yet war is never mentioned in the novel. There are soldiers, officers only of course, but their sole military duties are flirtation and to supply dance partners.The true conflict, in fact the only conflict of the Bennet family, is the struggle to marry off the eligible daughters before their father dies. Primogeniture is the evil djinn of the plot and Mrs. Bennet and the daughters are never unaware of the perils of their situation. They live one heart beat away from being thrown out of their estate by the male heir, their cousin Mr. Collins. Their only options are marriage or a life of dependency on a relative's charity. The girls are untrained. They can never earn their livings and the only skills they possess are those required of a wife, a companion, and a homemaker. Here I am thinking of Jane and Elizabeth. The youngest, Lydia, runs away with a scoundrel officer and almost brings the family to ruin. The other two daughters, Mary and Kitty, are mere bookends of little note, useful perhaps to illustrate the unlimited production of Bennet daughters, and to highlight the misfortune of never having produced a son.Every unattached man the family encounters is defined by fortune. Darcy has an income of 10,000. and Bingley 5,000. Once these two are corralled, the fate of the rest of the family is secure and the novel ends with satisfaction. The great peril is that these two wealthy bachelors will not be induced to perform their assigned tasks, finding and wedding two suitable wives from an otherwise often embarrassing Bennet family. Among the great delights of this novel are the nuances of character displayed and the modulations of the central personages as fortune and misfortune threaten and abate.Loss of place and social ostracism run behind every line of text and the wonder of Jane Austen's novel is that the threat of material want is ever present and yet is rarely noted. In polite company such matters are never discussed, but they are implicit in every second of existence. The stress is desperate and the courage of the characters immense. Since it is never expressed, it is possible to imagine it lies hidden in their minds but never given place in speech.Dialectical materialism can understand and find clarity in the situation of the Bennet family. A rereading of Das Kapital might be a useful sequel to this great novel.	5
No matter how many times I read this book, it still makes me smile. An American classic beyond measure! It will forever withstand the test of time!	5
Most importantly it was FREE; glad it was available on the &#34;free&#34; list as it was required for Book Club reading; It made a great addition to my kindle library;	5
Great classic, couldn't put it down. I liked being able to read it on my kindle. Finding some of the old classics sometimes can be difficult. I like the fact that I can find these through amazon.	4
One of the best books, or maybe the best book I've ever read! I loved it!!!! I am excited to watch the movie, then I will read this book again and again!	5
I had read it before but enjoyed reading it again. It had been along time since I read it last.	4
Good tale! It was funny, heart warming and holds your attention until the end. It is definitely worth the read!	5
I bet you just loved that Mr. Darcy. Well, yes. Yes, Tom Hanks. I did just love that Mr. Darcy.	5
An amazing book. After watching the movie more than 20 times I always wanted to read this. It was as great as the movie and a must read/watch.	4
Wonderful look back into a more romantic time. When ladies were proper ladies, and men were true gentlemen. Sweet love.	5
Everyone should read this. The English in it is from the era it was written. It shows us how much grammar has changed over the years. Not always for the good.. Also the progress women have made in having control over their lives.	5
great read! Loved the electronic format even though it is a little different from have the feel of a book.	5
I like classic stories. This book is nice and is the first one that I got for my kindle so nice.	5
This was a Christmas present for my Mom. She likes it but says that it is easy to put down. it came in great shape and the shipping was very fast.	4
Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is one of my all time favorite novels. It is a phenomenal read and well worth downloading.	5
What is there to say that hasn't already been said? That in my head I switch back and forth between Colin Firth and Sir Lawrence Olivier as Darcy? I'm certain that's been said.....read it for the first time or read it again. Top 5 best opening lines of a novel ever.	5
I really enjoyed this book. When it was required reading in school and I totally disliked it. It's amazing how much I enjoyed it. I'll have to go revisit some more classics	5
I have read this book many times and never get tired of it. It's my all time favourite. The characters come to life. This is realisistic of the period.	5
Marvelous classic love story, a really great read. I would recommend it to anyone, Jane Austen's writing is entertaining and extremely amusing	5
With author Jane Austen, how can you go wrong. If you enjoy historical romantic fiction, you will enjoy this book.	5
I'm not a big reader, but I had trouble putting this book down. When I was done reading it, I rented the movie for 24 hrs and watched it 3 times.	5
Such a fun and classic tail of two good people who have a great deal of person integrity, who are both force by their personal honesty re-evaluate their prejudices and opinions. Once start their intregity cause them to make significant adjustments to their behavior and opinions and see the good in the other that what they had previously found abhorrent became quickly their ambition and goal.	5
Such a beautiful and well told love story! I fell in love with Mr Darcy while becoming envious of Elizabeth's charismatic character at the same time.	5
Honestly, I found this book pretty boring. The premise of the novel is a big &#34;so what&#34;. I really am not sure why this is such a classic and by people swoon over Jane Austen.	3
My favorite book of all time. This is a must read for everyone! Elizabeth Bennet is one of my favorite characters in literature ever!	5
I HAVE READ THIS BOOK MANY TIMES. WATCHED COLIN FIRTH IN THE MOVIE...GREAT..RECOMMEND FOR SOMEONE WHO LOVES THE CLASSICS AND ROMANCE	5
This was my third time to read this classic 19th century romance novel; as always, it was a delightful read. The witty banter, passion, and humor are expertly woven together to produce a story that is not only interesting, but riddled with new, interesting words and facts (this was where I learned what an entail was, long before Downton Abbey). I would recommend this to anyone!	5
Okay, I'll admit that at 14 y o and interested in modern biographies and war stories, Pride & Prejudice bored me stupid.Re-reading it now (from a sense of obligation) I actually can see the humour in it, the easy development of characters and their relationships and interactions.I can now identify characters to loathe (the girls' mother) and which I can like.But I guess it will never be more than a tedious &#34;okay&#34;, I guess.	3
I loved the book, a well-known English classic, and felt compelled to give it a good rating. I do have one criticism of the eBook format for this particular edition. While I was reading through the book I noticed, more than 100 times, that the book was inappropriately formatted. There were new paragraphs where no paragraphs should be (...Mr. (praragraph inserted) Darcy...), this was only a minor distraction, but it did become a bit annoying, and it is an easy problem to fix. Paragraph insertion also took place between sentences, this became especially confusing with paragraph long dialogues. Great book, but the formatting needs a bit of work	4
The Collins classics version is outstanding. It's inexpensive ($6 or so when I purchased), though compact it is very legible. The paper is thick enough so that the font on the other side doesn't show through. Binding is tight though the spine gets bent quite a lot even after one read through. What I particularly enjoyed was the Collins classic English literature dictionary in the back. It includes many outdated or no longer used terms and words so that you don't have to reach for the computer if you don't really know what an 'entail' is or what 'persnickety' means. But it is a compact, standard mass market paperback size, and that's my one beef.As for the novel. Classic English literature is amazing, and this novel is one of the cornerstones of the 19th century English literature scene. Along with Dickens and the Bronte sisters, Austen's novels seem to capture the lives of the English in these times. Though Pride and Prejudice deals mainly with the wealthy, or at least the privileged class, we get to see a wonderful story unfold. Like the title states, this story deals with the pride of one character and the prejudice of another. Many peripheral plots unfold and help add to the overall story while the main plot moves along quite well.It's a novel that is often placed on reading lists in school, though I feel that in reading this in my early 30s that I can really truly grasp the emotions and trials of these characters more completely. If you read this when young, then do yourself a service and re-read this novel. It's amazing! Then watch the Colin Firth BBC series.	5
Absolutely amazing! Probably my favorite book ever, and that's a lot coming from an English major. Most would agree it's Austen's best work.	5
I really enjoyed reading this book. I have saw the movie, but as always, nothing compares to the book. I did have to re-read a few lines only because of the way they spoke. But seeing most of the movie first and then reading the novel helped out tremendously. A great read!!	5
I thoroughly enjoyed reading (and rereading) this book. The kindle version is great for checking unknown words in the dictionary.	5
This was a wonderful addition to my Kindle. Well formatted and easy to read. This author is timeless. I will enjoy gifting this to my daughter one day and appreciate the electronic file which allows me to take it anywhere on my new Kindle.	5
I received the Kindle/Pride & Prejudice I ordered, on time and in excellent condition. Thank you for your prompt response. I love this story and can now enjoy reading it whenever I wish.	5
I was first turned on to the book, `Pride and Prejudice', when I picked up a copy of `Wuthering Heights' at my local book store. On the inside cover it suggested not to miss `Pride and Prejudice' and `Romeo & Juilet'. So of course, I bought them as well!When I first started reading the book, being that it was written in 1813 and the language being slightly different then, I found the book a little hard to get into. Although, once I got to know the characters and the story began to unfold, I found myself unable to put the book down (literally). The romance, as well as the relationship, between Elizabeth Bennet & Mr. Darcy was highly intriguing and only added to the chemistry that makes this love story truly amazing! Now, I don't want to give away any of the juiciness that lies within the book so I won't say anymore. You'll really just have to read the book!NOTE: While browsing around, it appears that other authors have written books continuing the `Pride and Prejudice' story regarding the lives and love of Mr. Darcy & Elizabeth Bennet. So that might be worth looking into for those who've already read and fell in love with, `Pride and Prejudice'!	5
This is a great novel and the public domain Kindle edition is flawlessly presented with no random symbols, mispellings, omitted words, or anything else.Just to make it clear, Public Domain books is the name of the publisher of this edition. This novel can be enjoyed by anyone, as long as they are not male sexists. Women can write great literature too. This has all right to be called an alltime classic.	5
"Pride and Prejudice" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading "Pride and Prejudice" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy ("I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them ("No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett ("Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do").Despite its mildly stuffy style, "Pride and Prejudice" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read.	5
I enjoyed the story. Very interesting as how women where suppose to behave. I'm glad we've as women have evolved.	3
I have read this book and have seen the movie so many times that I know the book by heart. It is such a romantic story in a world that is far from the one we live in today. What an adventure that ends just the way you hoped. I love, I love, I love you!	5
You know that book that you adored so much the first time you read it that you wanted to open it right back up and read it over again? This is that book. Clever, compelling, and wonderfully crafted - P&P is the very best of Jane.	5
Unfortunately watched the movie first but the book by no means disappointed. My newest favorite. I fell in love with Mr. Darcy all over again.	5
Doesn't matter how many times I read P&P I never get tired of it, it's still the best! Perfect example of true romance, will always be a must read. Many people opt for just watching the movie however, i recommend you give the book a chance and read it least once, it will not disappoint!!	5
I have lost count how many times I have read this novel. I own more versions and copies of it than I could ever justify. Beautiful from start to finish and more enlightening with each read	5
Reading this elegant and attractive book, along with the 200th anniversary of the book, has a very special effect and meaning. I am currently rereading the book, and find it more beautiful and more intimate.	5
A classic I just read for the first time. I can see why it's a classic!I'm sure I'll be reading it again.	4
Nothing better than a classic Jane Austen book read on a modern technological marvel! Love my Kindle and love being able to download the classics for free!	5
After enjoying several movie versions of this book I wanted to read the original, and was not disappointed. The only (minor) thing I found was the &#34;soap opera&#34; quality of much of the dialogue.	4
This book is a classic for a reason. I get lost in the time period and how today we can be so similar even though things are so different. Great love, great book.	5
I have watched the three versions of P&P on TV/Movies and loved them. So now I wanted to read the book. So far I am loving it also.	5
The story took you back to old England, loves lost and loves restored. I would recommend this to men and women.	5
Really enjoyed reading this book finally. I had seen the movie and the play. I enjoyed it very much and will be looking for Sense and Sensibility next.	5
Some things were harder to understand however I really liked the use of 3 different possible loves and how they played out. I'm planning on reading it a second time after others have been read	4
I so enjoy Miss Austen' s lively characters. She does a masterful job of showing me a picture of life during this era - both the serious and the absurd.	5
I thought it was a good book, but definitely a hard read. I had to read it for school. And I thought it was a great love surely and I liked how the women rolled were powerful.	3
Beautiful, classic story. The descriptive language brings to mind romance, fancy balls and gallantry no longer found in this modern age.	4
This book is obviously a classic and easy to read. However, the amount of characters is too much to follow and also the author sometimes doesn't let the reader know when a different character is speaking. Which made it a bit frustrating fir the first couple if chapters. Also, I did not feel attached to the characters. Their emotions were held back through the whole book, so when Darcy and Elizabeth finally get together it is not as exciting and heart wrenching as it should be.	3
Great read. Enjoyed it very much. Going to read it for a second time. really enjoyed the read. Great story and book.	3
I had never read this book as a young person and am really enjoying the author. The version of writing is slow to read and comprehend, but the story is captivating.	5
Easy to get on my Kindle and to transport it everywhere. Rapid download to all my connected electronics. And you cannot go wrong with so little money for it. Love those classics.	5
A true classic. An all-time favorite. I recommend this read to everyone! I love that Amazon offers free Austen e-books.	5
Classicly a period piece, thus slower to read due to the verbiage, but, certainly worth the read! I enjoyed her characters and though the places were not as richly described as I would have liked, it was enough. Several new (actually &#34;olde&#34;) words have been added to my vocabulary!	4
This book is very hard to read but made easier with the kindle, great story line, funny in parts too.	4
We use this book in school and its amazing how all of the things that happened in the book you have to read it	5
For being still in high school, I enjoyed this book so much that I should think it a must to read again when I am older. This was by far the best "classic" I have ever read and may just be one of the best books I have ever read.All books will now be held to a different standard. The characters were completely enthralling. This book is the embodiment of all great reads.	5
If you have not read this since high school, you may find yourself quite delighted, as I did myself .	5
Guess I am giving this book an unfair report, as I didn't get to even get it read. So Inshouldnt be a judge for the book.	2
Haven't got time to read it yet, but the book cover looks great and brand new. Happy with the purchase!!	5
Love this book! That's all I have to say about it. I knew the story really well, from all the movies, etc. But I really enjoyed reading it, especially for as cheap as it is on amazon!	5
[...]Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen has got to have one of the best male characters of all time, Mr. Darcy. I won't go into detail about the plot, it's a tried and true story, done many times in many forms of movie, I'll cover just a few here. But Mr. Darcy is the epitome of men. A specimen worth lusting over, he is the type of man that all women secretly want. Tall, handsome, and true, he is arrogant, prideful (or not prideful? That's for you to decide), and conceited. He's the type of man that although confident, will make you feel like once he takes you in his arms, you are safe and loved forever. There are many wonderful reasons to read this book, but I believe Mr. Darcy is the main reason women have been reading it for generations.Besides Mr. Darcy, my next favorite characters are Lizzie and her father, a relationship worth noting. They have an affection and understanding betwixt them that is both endearing and enviable. He understands her in a way that most don't and does his best to protect her from her worst enemy, her mother, the one who is always trying to give her away to the first available man. He is commendable. The other daughters are not as noteworthy, obviously Lydia is meant to be childish and annoying and it comes across well. Someone should have slapped that child silly. I almost wish two characters, Mary, the middle sister, and Charlotte, Elizabeth's best friend, had gotten more play. I understand Charlotte was there to represent the many women out there that are sensible and marry for reasons other than love, and so we need her, but it didn't seem fair she got the short end of the stick. And poor Mary, who just wanted to shine in her own way, whether through her demurely moral comments or her piano playing, and was often ignored or rebuffed. I think she had merit and would have liked to see her end up with someone. Alas, it was Elizabeth's story, and more so Mr. Darcy's and so we must focus on them. I absolutely loved it and it was just another example of Austen's genius.[...]	5
This book was a nice, romantic novel with lovely descriptions allowing you to transport fully into the story. There were ironies and plenty of opportunities to dwell on the intricacies of the characters. Books today are rarely written with the depth of language and description found in Pride and Prejudice. It makes it even more touching to read knowing that Jane Austin, the author, faced a similar "socially forbidden" love without quite the happy ending found in this epic.Pride and Prejudice	5
I originally read Pride and Prejudice in a college English class almost 40 years ago and got this copy to reread for a class I am taking now. The book is just as wonderful as I remember it!	5
Always a great read. Characters are so endearing but also real in their good points and flaws. Just great writing as a whole like always with Austen.	5
Sometimes you have no choice but to flow with the story, because it won't let you go. I love reading a book into which I can get so deep, I forget my internal editor exists. I forget anyone who might be in the room with me, I ignore the ring of the phone.When this happens, I don't even realize until I've finished the book how blessed I've been to have become part of that excellent story, to live within the characters, feel their heartbreak, their joy, smell the proverbial roses around them. These stories are rare, but Pride and Prejudice is one of them. I'm sure I've read it dozens of times, and I hope to read it dozens more.	5
The story of Pride and Prejudice is beautifully narrated by Kate Redding. She narrates male characters just as well as female characters. She doesn't leave you wondering which character is speaking in the narrative, either. I really enjoy listening to any book Kate Redding narrates because she really puts personality into the voices of every character in the story. This audio-book is a must-have for Jane Austen fans and audio-book listeners alike!	5
I've watched the movie several times now I can say I've read the book. Really good will keep in on my kindle to reread!	5
Pride & Prejudice is a great way to connect to the 1800s. The way of living, the values and morale, the main characters are so much fun... I felt like Elizabeth, strong in character, always doing the right thing, but enjoying her life to the fullest. The proper use of dissipating vocabulary is refreshing...	5
I love this book it was very good. I could not put it down.I look forward in reading more on my Android phone.	5
I read this book for the first time when I was maybe 10 or 11 years old. I came across it in my elementary school library, and was hesitant at first because the title suggested similarity to Crime & Punishment (let's be frank, Dostoevsky simply cannot appeal to a relatively normal 5th grader). I was way off base in this assumption, and have been smitten with P&P ever since that first reading. The story & characters never get old, and although some adaptations & variations are enjoyable to read, nothing can ever be quite like the original. If you haven't done so yet, read it. Please. You won't be sorry.	5
Pride and Prejudice is a complete masterpiece. I was very disappointed at myself for not reading it sooner. I will recommend this book to anyone who loves reading. Everyone should read this at-least once.	5
I love this book. Reading it after I saw the movie helped me make a mental movie of what is going on as I read.	5
This is an excellent book, a true piece of classic literature. I highly recommend it because I had to refresh myself from high school reading and I really appreciated the story more the second time around.	5
This book is the only book that I have read twice and I WILL read it again and again over my lifetime! There are so many great quotes.	5
A Classic, but now on my smartphone... to read everywhere, anytime, anyplace.... a dream! I've read this book and I've seen the movie(s) several times now, but I can still dream along with Elisabeth and her Darcy	5
It is great to be able to read old books in a new view. Who would have thought, books on my phone?	5
How can this not be at 5? I have read this book a dozen times, and watched every version of the movie. This is the epitome of regency romance, the bedrock on which they all are based. The story of Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy is a classic, this one you must read. Told a few hundred years ago,it's magic endures. What a feat to write a book still loved so long afterwards. If you have never read this, then a great treat is in store. If you have, well do so again. And its free on kindle. What is not to like?!	5
These two attributed apply to us all, especially in love between the sexes. Feelings without communication are not always known to the other.	5
I thoroughly enjoyed this version of the timeless classic. My first time reading it and I cannot understand what took me so long.	5
Great read I loved the descriptions and I want to applaud the author.Be get the red fall but then	5
I had never read this book but always heard about it....loved it,great exppression on the turmoils of the human heart and people in general.	5
Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful classic novel. It is the captivating story of two people almost losing the opportunity of finding happiness together by being proud and making incorrect assumptions about each other through the influences of others. The era is one of a leisurely life spent in rambling homes, going to balls and seeking romance. He is a rich and seemingly arrogant gentleman and she is a poor and very feisty young lady in a large, happy family of girls who must marry well. Throughout the book, the author is so clever in getting the reader to understand the good and bad tension that exists between Mr Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett. It's the kind of book you can't put down when you're reading it and the kind that can be read over and over again.	5
If you are looking for the classic love story with the right amount of action, drama, romance and a heroine that draws you in, this is the story for u.	5
I absolutely loved "Pride and Prejudice", best purchase I've made yet on Amazon. Keira Knightley is magnificent as well as all of the other actors. I have watched this movie several times and it always brings tears to my eyes.	5
This is a wonderful classic, I have renewed my acquaintance with the Bennet family and friends. One irritating factor in the text was the use of -- instead of the county names, which was somewhat annoying. I presume this was due to a lack of precise editing. I would thoroughly recommend the novel to anyone who likes a timeless good read.	5
I have read and re-read Pride and Prejudice many times and never failed to be moved by the beauty of the language. In myView it is one of the finest books in the English language	5
This is one of my all time favorites. I have read it three times. I like it because it really is a book about the folly of being judgemental.Elizabeth Bennett observes her sisters as being a flighty and air headed. Yet they all seem to find husbands and happiness before her. All of them except poor Mary, she kind of reminds me of myself actually, she's the nerdy one.Elizabeth judges everyone, her mother, her father, her sisters and especially Mr. Darcy. In fairness, he deserves the harsh judgement, no one calls Elizabeth Bennett plain, no matter how rich he is!It is written in high prose style, but don't be put off by it. Pride and Prejudice is a beautifully written book and well worth reading.	5
THERE IS A REASON FOR THIS BOOK BEING A CLASSIC. IT IS A CHARACTER STUDY PAR EXCELLENCE!!!!EVEN THOUGH THE HABITS AND MORES OF 18 CENTURY ENGLAND WERE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM OURS, THE HUMANITY OF THE PEOPLE ARE THE SAME.THE TITLE TELLS THE STORY---2 PEOPLE EACH DENOTING THE CHARACTER TRAITS GIVEN THEM IN THE TITLE--AND HOW THEY FINALLY COME TO A MEETING OF THE MIND AND HEART.THIS BOOK IS TO BE ENJOYED MANY TIMES OVER!!!	5
I researched this book, but it does not come out and tell you that the dover thrift edition is unabridged, it states something to the effect of "like orginal 1813 writing". So this edition, the dover thrift edition is unabridged.	5
This book is a favorite of mine. I probably have read this story twice a year, without fail, for ten years. Some things never get old.	5
I ordered this book for my Kindle Fire as a retirement read. It's nice to be able to read the classics at my leisure.	5
This is the love story that you will judge all other love stories by. As well, your romantic life will be judged if you can find your own Mr. Darcy. Jane Austen is a great book and one that all teenage girls will enjoy.	5
I love this story and can read it again and again because it continues to make my heart skip a beat!	5
ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok and it was free so not too bad	4
I didn't realize there were full-page color pictures peppered throughout the book! the artwork is absolutely stunning, and captures the characters in all the youth and beauty that Jane Austen probably intended them to have. Mr. Wickham is absolutely dashing!! I can't believe I got a 1940s edition in such good condition and for such a great deal.	5
I love rereading this story. The moral of it is timeless. It's a classic for a reason. Easy format, too.	5
It kept me guessing.There was a variety of income levels as to the characters. It was unexpected as to which guy the ladies would end up with!	5
Long and wordy. Don't read it when you are tired as it does require some concentration. Keep your characters straight!	4
I love this book. I try to read it every year. It is always good for quiet get away weekend.	5
I loved this book! Once I started reading, I could not stop.It has a similar plot line to Sense & Sensibility, but S&S; moves very sloooooww. P&P; was much more enjoyable & interesting. I plan on reading it again soon.Because of the era it was written, some of the language is hard to understand & some conversations in the book, I had no clue what they were talking about. But overall it was understandable.As some people have stated, I did notice a lot of typos in the free Kindle version. It was annoying to have such a thing, but it was free & didnt make me love the story any less.	5
"Pride and Prejudice" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading "Pride and Prejudice" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy ("I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them ("No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett ("Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do").Despite its mildly stuffy style, "Pride and Prejudice" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read.	5
One of my favorite Authors of all time if your looking for a classical romance this is a must read.	5
So...what to say about this. Well, it surely is a girly book since the majority of the story is about romance. There are also themes of family, marriage, society, class, etc. The story was pretty good but boring in some parts. However, the ending really left me wanting a sequel. It made me want to know about *spoiler* the life after Elizabeth and Darcy's marriage. I also wanted to know how Darcy's sister will turn out and if she will also find her fated one. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet's situation in life is also greatly altered. It would have been interesting to see how they will get along and if there would be any rekindling of past fires or not. The two unmarried sisters can also be a topic of exploration, especially Kitty seeing as to how civil and improved she's becoming. I will miss Elizabeth and Darcy's witty conversations and I would have been delighted to read about a jealous Darcy. A sequel would have been perfect. Seriously, it would have been fun to read about their life after marriage and if they were going to have any kids or not. Then maybe there would be someone new in town who would intimidate Darcy and fight for Elizabeth's affection, which of course, can only belong to Darcy. Ohh! The possibilities are endless! How I wish for a sequel. Before anyone else writes one though, I will have to be satisfied with my imagination. I am aware of the fanfiction sequels out there, but there will never be a true sequel to this book. I'm also curious as to whether Elizabeth would conform to the upper class or not. Wonders if she improves her piano and other skills like the arts. And their kids.....would they be more like Elizabeth or Darcy? Hmm....	4
I had borrowed this CD set from my local library, and the narration by Nadia May is so wonderful, I had to buy a copy for myself. Ms. May's British accent and interpretation of the story and characters is thoroughly entertaining. She really brings this classic novel to life. Highly recommended!	5
I was very pleased with the book I received. It was all that was represented and in excellent shape. The delivery was very quick and without problem. This was only my second order on Amazon and was very pleased with all aspects.Signature Classics - Pride and Prejudice (Signature Classics Series)	4
This is, in my opinion, the best novel Jane Austen wrote, although Mansfield Park follows close on its heels. And while there are a few spelling and grammatical errors here and there in the kindle edition, it is worth it to have it on kindle. This fast-paced story is hard to put down, and if you have not yet read it you really should give it a try. Forget the many versions you may have seen of the movie, which even the best of does not do justice to the novel, and sit yourself down with this for a wonderful ride. Humorous, witty and entertaining, it is well worth your time!	5
It is said that a good work of fiction represents the ways and manners of the people during the period when it was written. Being the case, I have a number of observations:1. The conversations feel that the parties involved are having an oratorical debate. It was an art in itself. Obviously, nobody speaks this way anymore. The language was so lyrical, very personally addressed, either face to face or through a proper letter.2. It was a time when ladies were expected (as dictated by good manners, decorum and propriety) to have knowledge of the arts and music. In contrast to the present time, parents and elders lovingly cultivate/develop the natural talents of their children. For those with no natural inclination, it is openly accepted as such, and never forced. At least this is what I have observed in general.3. It is a good thing that women of the present time share an equal footing with men (at least in many parts of the world), that they are not just relegated to marriage when they become of age. Imagine being set for marriage the moment a girl turns 16, with the mother almost in panic if her daughter is not engaged by the time she's twenty!4. What a closed and judgmental society it was during that time. The elopement of one daughter to an "undeserving" man ruined not only her reputation but that of her whole family as well, in the process making her other sisters almost unfit for marriage.5. Fifty miles of good road equals half a day's journey by carriage! Thank God for the automobile!I enjoyed this novel a lot, though it took some time for me to read because of the lyrical prose, which I am not so used to, and also the typos. Just the same, lyrical prose and all, it brought about the same excited feelings as when I read modern chick-lit fiction. I would have rated this a complete 5-star if not for the many typos in the Kindle edition.	4
I'm reviewing the Penguin Classics edition rather than the content of the novel itself (which is wonderful). The cover is beautifully decorated, nicely textured, and sturdy, the introduction and notes are interesting but not obtrusive, the paper is high quality, the print is very readable (the font is not too small like some other editions of classic literature), and the colored ribbon adds a touch of refinement as well as utility. I've bought the other Austen novels in this Penguin series. They're among the most handsome books on my library shelf. Highly recommended.	5
Pride and Prejudice is a novel to be read time and again to descipher new innuendos and witty remarks. The characters are beautifully crafted and the relationships they form complex. The novel remains an important social and historical commentary. It is an easy and charming book to read for young adults and rich and complex for those who want to re-read it.	5
i finnaly decided to read this classic because i have heard so much about it. I absolutly loved it! i didnt think i would enjoy it as much as i did since it was written a long time ago but i have read it 2 times since downloading it!	5
I'm really liking the Kindle and its nearly unlimited supply of free books. I'd read this book long ago, and still like it. I like the dictionary feature in the software. I'm going to give a couple of kindle this year for Christmas. Better than a bookshelf filled with great classics like this one, don't know how anybody could give Pride and Prejudice anything but a five-star.	5
Read this in H.S re-read it through my phone. Font is a good size, exactly as I remember it great buy.	5
Pride & Prejudice is a classic. A must read for anyone who loves a good love story. Jane Austen was a master of plot and characters, the story is simply brilliant.	5
It seems almost pointless to write a simple review on this book, but I'm going to anyway. I had to read this for my Women in Literature and Visual Arts class, and it was enjoyable. The characters are well developed, and the plot is simple enough to understand. Overall the book was a bit dry for my personal taste, but it was still good. Jane Austen is a superb author, so it is certainly worth reading.	5
I loved this when I was 15. I still adore the book three decades later. Timeless romance with people we still fall in love with today, as well as characters who make us want to pull our hair out. The writing style may be a bit intense for those who have grown to short, one and two sentence paragraphs and action that rushes at you, but if you enjoy savouring words and characters and moments, it is magnificent.	5
Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a classic that has touched generations for years. Once I picked it up I couldn't put it down, Austen immediately sucks you in with witty word play, dramatic irony, and catching plot points. The novel captures a wide audience, whether the reader is a hopeless romantic or more practical. It appeals to everyone; I can guarantee that future readers will not be disappointed. The main character, Elizabeth, is complex, stubborn, and full of wit. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy both exude passion. Although there are multiple story lines the majority of the plot revolves around the love-hate relationship of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet. Their relationship is full of twists and turns that are incredibly enticing to the audience. "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife," this is the opening line of the novel, and it is perhaps one of the most know phrases in literature. It is incredibly ironic, and ties into the whole book.Pride and Prejudice is a spectacular book for the reason that it leaves readers wanting nothing. Some readers may say that it is an unrealistic ending, because many of the main characters had their fairy tale ending. In my opinion that is what makes this book a great read. There aren't enough happy endings in the world, but when reading about them it feels as if it's your own personal happy ending. Overall, it's a classic romance that I would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys a clever, well written, and whirlwind romance.	5
I read this for my English class, and I have to say that I loved it! The writing is absolutely beautiful. Anyone that wants to read some real literature needs to check out Jane Austen. Pride & Prejudice is a great story and a wonderful window into the English Regency Era. Expect to laugh and daydream. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth forever &lt;3	5
Rich and complex characters, entertaining subplots, believable and relatable characters, but scanty romance. The pace is too slow for my liking, so I probably won't reread it. Literary fiction with romantic elements.	5
When the book came in, it was in perfect condition. It was a gift for my girlfriend because she loves Pride and Prejudice as well as books with classic and artful bindings. It was a perfect gift and I plan on buying the collection.	5
My kidd is a readerholic and she loved it. It's great when the youth of today can cherish great author's of the past.	5
What a pleasure to read! The extra insights are wonderful! The observations are sometimes humorous and add to the text. I only wish there was another book after this one, or two or three. :)	5
Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a book of great literature merit. The articulate language and complex characters draw the reader into the story of sisters trying to find their place in life. The way in which it is written is rare to find in today's society, creating a sense of mystery and the unknown about society of the past. Elizabeth Bennett, the heroine of the novel, is a character that is easily relatable to for women both in the time that it was written and for modern women today. She struggles internally to find where her heart truly belongs, and leads the reader to question whether they themselves are actually proud and/or prejudiced.	5
Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a masterpiece and the Penguin Hardcover classic version is pure pleasure to read. The screen printed cover is novel and appealing - though some of the image came away with the sticker on the back. It has a good size/shape/heft and the pages have a nice thickness to them. I did not notice any errors in the text. I have not yet read the introduction to this book, but have greatly enjoyed the introductions included in other Penguin Hardcover classics (especially Jane Eyre).I definitely recommend this copy of Pride and Prejudice. Not only is it delightful to read, but it also looks lovely on the shelf.	5
I had the pleasure of being assigned this book in my senior year English Literature class. It quickly became my favorite book. 20+ years later....I've read it cover-to-cover so many times, I wore the binding off. I now have this on my Kindle and read my favorite chapters quite often.Don't we all secretly wish for our own Mr. Darcy?	5
This was my breakthrough, oh my God I love reading, book back in high school. I always did well in English class, but I never deeply loved literature until we read this book. I read far beyond the assigned pages in class because I loved Jane Austen's writing, her characters, and her witty lines. I often found myself smiling and occasionally laughing while reading the book. This book had such a profound influence on my life that I'm now an English major in college. After reading this I sought out other books in the same style like the Bronte sisters. Over the years, I've basically forced all of my friends and poor boyfriends to read this book so I could talk about it with them. I'd recommend this book to absolutely anyone who can understand and tolerate the language and dialogue. I'd recommend reading the first few pages for free here on Amazon, and if you can follow the writing of the time, get this book right away. You'll love it.	5
This is a true timeless british classic romance. It's wonderful to read from one of the best known authors in british classic literature.	5
Pride and Prejudice is a work of perfection. Jane Austin really knows how to make the characters come alive and you experience the book as if you are the one telling the story. You also get to see what life would have been like back then, you get to see and experience something you would not have otherwise experienced yourself. I am sure it was not an easy task to write feelings for another person. Unless you experience them yourself, how can you say it for another? The book kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next, and I truly did not want to put it down, until I had read it all. If you like history, romance, and a great story line then I would highly recommend this book.	5
Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen masterfully tells this story which helps the reader engage in the relationships of people. Like her earlier compelling novel, Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice is a romance story. Although there are many different printings of this work, T. Egerton, Whitehall first published it in January 28th 1813 with roughly 370 pages. While the original print did not have illustrations the first wonderful pictures were by Pickering & Greatbatch.Pride and Prejudice owes much of its popularity to its vivid portrayal of character. The story is set in early 19th-century England, a trying time for any unmarried maiden. Elizabeth, the second eldest of the Benett sister, was as open as a closed book shielding her true feelings. While Mr. Darcy would proudly separate himself from the common folk. Both characters are very likable despite their flaws.This pleasurable tale begins with the worries of a caring mother. Back then it was incredibly important for women to get married and none of her five daughters had. Thankfully a young bachelor by they name of Mr. Bingley came to town and was immediately attracted to the oldest Benett sister, Jane. Elizabeth on the other hand was somewhat fond of Mr. Darcy but he seemed to show no interest. Although Jane and Mr. Bingley had grown quite close, he left along with the rest of his party leaving a brokenhearted Jane behind. Elizabeth found out that Mr. Darcy was the one who convinced Mr. Bingley to go. While she was visiting at a friend's house she and Mr. Darcy crossed paths and he tried to propose to her. Still upset that he had broken up Mr. Bingley and her sister she declined the proposal.After a heated argument with Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth saw eye to eye with him and realized they had both been prejudice and maybe a little proud. Fortuitously, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy both moved back to town were they showed up to the Benett's house and had a somewhat awkward conversation. Later Mr. Bingley, who arrived alone, asked if he could speak to Jane apart from the other. A proposal maybe? If that wasn't enough to fill the mind of Elizabeth, knowing she thinks of Mr. Darcy differently would.Interestingly Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy both recognized that they were prideful and prejudice. Which hints to why the title is call Pride and Prejudice. They're imperfect characters, and that's what people like about them! When I was reading this book I realized what made it different from other romance novels is that the love unfolded gradually. At some points in the book it seemed as if they didn't like each other at all. A lot of stories now a days quickly get to the point, forgetting that telling the story is the best part.	5
I wanted to read some of the classic novels that are available for Kindle, and now I am hooked! This book was so rich in characters, story and setting, that I felt I had taken a trip back in time, to another era. A wonderful story, that kept me reading into the night. A classic, English romance. Loved it!	5
I love Pride & Prejudice. It's one of my all time favorite books. Therefore, and because it was free, it was the first book I downloaded for my Kindle. I have to say I found some typos in the edition. I'm not sure who's uploading these things but I don't like not being able to trust the content.	3
It was a good book and i enjoyed it greatly. I read it to help myself when i take the AP test in the spring for english.	5
Love love love the book. This ebook had quite a few typos, but nothing that made it unreadable. Plus, it was free, so I'm not complaining.	5
I've read this book many times, I love Jane Austen. So now I am thrilled to have this beautiful love story on my kindle fire, which I have once again read. This story always makes me smile.	5
I adore this book. It's a classic for a reason and is worth being read over and over. Look for the subtle humor!	4
This is the best romance novel. We all want to find our Mr. Darcy. I'd even settle for Mr. Bingley. I love getting into Lizzie's world and reading about her journey to love.	5
I have read this book five or six times! It is almost lyrical, or musical in the cadence of delivery. I do love it. I will read it again and again. It is like Jane Austen crystalized a period for us and polished it into a gem to enjoy for lifetimes to come!	5
This is a digital version of my favorite book. You can't go wrong with that. It was a great addition to my kindle.	5
es un muy buen libro y tienes la oportunidad de buscar el significado de las palabras inmediatamente , es bueno para empazar a leer en el kindle	5
One of my favorite stories. Love the old movie about it. Sort of a different take on the story of Cinderella or the rags to riches theme.	5
Loved this book. Love all the characters. One of my all time favorite love stories! All young girls should be required to read it....	5
Its been my favorite book for last 25 years. It is one of the books that keeps feeling new everytime I read it.	5
I love Jane Austen's books and Pride and Prejudice was the firts one I read and I fell in love with it. So I wanted to have this one on my Kindle. I've bought my Kindle recently so i wanted to know how it will work. For me, everything is alright and Pride and Prejudice is a classic. I also own this book in hard cover. Plus, it's for free.	5
BEST WRITTEN AUSTEN BOOK IN MY OPINION. THE FAMILY DYNAMICS ARE HILARIOUS AND HEARTWARMING. LIKE CHATTING WITH AN OLD FRIEND WHEN I READ THIS BOOK.	5
Everything was as expected. Timely delivery, great condition, worked as prescribed. If you question this product or this particular vendor, sleep easy. They are great! Thanks again! -w	5
It is a work of art. How I have fallen in love with these characters!! The interactions between Lizzy and Darcy are so endearing. The language is beautiful!	5
This is most certain a timeless masterpiece in which Jane Austen achieved perfection. Pride and Prejudice is a reading bliss with its unique and beloved plot. The unsuspected decisions and changes of plot keep you on your toes wishing for more. The description and personalities of the characters is extraordinary and you feel yourself intrigued within the story, and falling in love with Mr. Darcy alongside Elizabeth. The end is perfect in every way possible, but you can't help yourself wishing for it not to end though. Her vocabulary and formality may at times be more difficult but it makes it all the more interesting. It's a timeless classic which I love and adore, and never tire of no matter how many times I read it! ~A.C.	5
This is written in the language of its day and is very enjoyable as a light read. If you've never read and like old fashioned romantic books this is a good one.	5
digital books are perfect and easy to use! They take up no space on the bookshelf and are always with you!!!	5
one of my favorite books ever, if you enjoy classic romance, you will absolutely love this. follow it with the movie staring kira knightly and you wont be sorry	5
One of my favorite books. Who would I recommend it to? Any literate person. This is classic fiction and very enjoyable however often you read it.	5
This book is Austen at her best. This classic never gets stale no matter how many times I read it. Great story, fascinating characters and wonderful descriptions of English society and class differences. You just can't go wrong with Jane Austen.	5
I know it's a &#34;classic&#34;, but....yawn.n.n.n. - archaic language and perfectly useless characters. Little more than local gossip among the local teens!	1
Eh this book was okay but i didnt really like it because i didnt understand it very much so eh	1
best book ever!! draws me into it so much! makes me stay up real late at night to read it!	5
when I saw this on t.v. I had to buy the book to get more out of the movie so far I have not finish the book yet	5
The book was ok. It was just a little drawn out for me. I doubt that I would read it again.	4
probably the best Jane Austin book I HAVE READ and I have read a few of them sorry it was finished	5
THis was a great book. It was very entertaining and has been just what I was looking for. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.	5
Fast and quick delivery. We also saw the movie so I can enjoy the book the more. I hope to enjoy this for years to come. Thanks for the great service.	5
The story line is good but the writing style takes a little getting used to. Jane Austen writes in long complicated sentence structures that sometime required me to reread a time or two to understand. I consider it a good mental exercise for my aging brain. I will continue to read her works.	4
What can one say regarding this all time classic. One cannot help but enjoy the vexations and joys of the Bennet family.	5
It took me 48 years to read this book and was delighted that it kept on the edge of my seat!	5
I have always wanted to read Pride and Prejudice, so you can imagine my joy when I found it for FREE on my Kindle.P&P; was exactly what I thought it would be, one of the greatest books Jane Austen has ever written.I immediately fell in love with Elizabeth's character, and just as immediately began to hate the characters of Lydia and Mrs. Bennett, Jane Austen wrote them so realistically that the three of them reminded me of people I knew in real life. You know an author is amazing at what they do when they can actually make you feel some sort of emotion with their characters, especially when the character is meant to be loved or hated.Well, that's all	5
What can I say this classic literature really have me insight to the past and kept my attention piqued. This is definitely a must read !!	4
I love som Pride and Prejudice. Big fan of the book and the movie. Go Jane Austen!!! Loved this love story.	5
A must read for all generations. I had seen the movie but never read the book until now and wished I had sooner.	5
Jane Austen has created a masterpiece that every girl should read at least once in their lifetime. I myself have read it at least twice per year since the age of sixteen. The characters are extremely well developed and the time period well defined. One of the best books of the period to be sure. Mr. Darcy is sure to win the hearts of every girl who reads about him. Emma is the next best book to follow up with, in my opinion.	5
This is not a review of the novel itself, (which is wonderful) but of the Winchester Austen Edition (henceforth WAE) of Pride and Prejudice, published by Word Press in 2007.After buying a copy of WAE &#34;Emma&#34; in Costco, I knew I had to have &#34;Pride & Prejudice&#34; in WAE as well. Here's why:-The WAE versions of Jane Austen's books are hardcover and physically comfortable in that they are printed on smooth white paper rather than typical beige rough paper and the typeface is solid roman type that is easy on the eyes.-The size is approximately 5X8. The corners of the pages are rounded giving it a soft look. The covers of all WAE, are completely black, except for the title and author and also have rounded corners. Attached to the back cover is an elastic band that goes around the height of the book and you can use this as a book mark or as a way to keep your book closed.-Each WAE novel has colorful inside covers depicting a scene from the novel and there are nice color drawings included in the introduction.-Each novel has at least three sets of notes written by Austen scholars. Most of the notes are the same in all the novels, but each novel has one additional note section peculiar to that novel. The notes that all editions have are a timeline in color of Jane Austen's world and a color map of Austen's England. In P&P; the additional notes is the illustrated Army in Austen's time.I bought used copies of WAE novels because even used, they are sturdy and comfortable. I am very hard on books by intention. I read while I eat, before I sleep, while waiting on lines, etc. But mainly, I like to embellish my books with beads, ribbons and lace, and even some rubber stamping on the white spaces in the text itself. I wouldn't have the heart to do that to an expensive hardcover.If you like the &#34;feel&#34; of books, I highly recommend the Winchester Austen Edition of any of Austen's novels. Let me know what you think.	5
Great book I read it in a week loved this classic book Lizzy and Darcy is a true love story	5
I know Jane Austen was a famous author but this book was written 200 years ago. I couldn't understand a lot of what was being said. Language was too old. I found it to be very boring and empty. Plot?? What plot??	1
Another of amazon's bad moves is to remove all ratings from the free versions so they virtually disappear from searches. Maybe put them back guys? This is totally available for free if you search by title instead of author. This is a classic.	1
Sirs,I returned this free e-book because, as I passed the pages it would return to the begining of the 2nd. or 3d. chapters that I had already read.I downloaded "Pride and Prejudice" in order to re-read it as we read it in High School, but I was exasperated because the pages kept skipping to the past chapters...Sorry about this.... By the way, thank you for the free e-books, anyway.....	1
